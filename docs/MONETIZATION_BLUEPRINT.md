## 2. 🤝 SALES PLAYBOOK (The VP of Sales)

### The "Cold DM" Script (Agency Focus)
*Targeting: PR Agency Owners, Reputation Management Directors*

**Platform:** LinkedIn / Twitter DM

> **Subject:** Your client's [Brand Name] Reddit thread
>
> Hey [Name],
>
> I noticed [Agency Name] represents [Client Brand].
>
> I ran a quick scan and found a few Reddit threads about them that traditional tools usually miss. One of them has 50+ comments discussing their [Specific Feature/Issue].
>
> We built a dedicated "Deep Brand Tracker" specifically to catch these discussions on Reddit/Hacker News in real-time.
>
> Can I send you a free "Shadow Report" of what we found for [Client Brand]? might be useful for your next client update.
>
> [Your Name]

### The "Objection Handling"

**Objection:** "Why should I pay you when Google Alerts is free?"

**The Titan Response:**
> "Google Alerts is great for broad news, but it's **reactive and blind** to social discussions.
> 1.  It misses 90% of Reddit, Twitter, and Hacker News threads (where crises actually start).
> 2.  It doesn't tell you *how* people feel (Sentiment Analysis).
> 3.  We alert you in **seconds** via Slack, not a daily email digest after the damage is done.
>
> Think of Google Alerts as a weekly newspaper, and us as a 24/7 security team."

### Target Job Titles
*   Crisis Management Director
*   Head of Public Relations
*   VP of Brand Marketing
*   Chief Reputation Officer
*   Founder (Series A/B Startups)

## 3. 📢 DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS (The Growth Hacker)

### Where to Post (High-Intent Communities)

1.  **r/Marketing & r/PublicRelations:**
    *   *Strategy:* "Case Study: How I caught a viral hate thread in 4 minutes and saved a client." (Do NOT just self-promote).
2.  **r/Entrepreneur & r/SaaS:**
    *   *Strategy:* "I built a tool to listen to my haters. Here's what I learned."
3.  **IndieHackers / Product Hunt:**
    *   *Strategy:* Launch as "The Google Alerts Killer for Startups."
4.  **G2 / Capterra:**
    *   *Strategy:* List under "Media Monitoring" and "Social Listening." Aggressively ask beta users for reviews.

### The "Viral Hook" (Lead Magnet)

**Tool:** **"The Free Brand Pulse Check"**
*   **Mechanism:** User enters their URL/Brand Name on the landing page.
*   **Deliverable:** We scrape the last 24h of Reddit/X and send a **one-time "Brand Health Scorecard"** (PDF/Email) with:
    *   Sentiment Breakdown (Positive/Negative).
    *   Top 3 recent mentions.
    *   "Risk Level" Assessment.
*   **Hook:** "Is your brand safe right now? Check your Risk Level in 30 seconds."

## 4. 🚀 EXIT STRATEGY (The VC)

### Potential Acquirers (Who buys this?)

1.  **Marketing Clouds (HubSpot, Sprout Social, Hootsuite):**
    *   *Why:* feature parity. They lack deep Reddit/Community listening capabilities.
2.  **PR & Crisis Firms (Edelman, Meltwater):**
    *   *Why:* To offer proprietary tech to their massive client lists.
3.  **Customer Support Platforms (Intercom, Zendesk):**
    *   *Why:* Expanding from "Support" to "Proactive Monitoring."

### Valuation Estimate (At $10k ARR)

*   **SaaS Multiplier (Pre-Seed/Seed):** 5x - 10x ARR if growth is >100% YoY.
*   **Tech Asset Value:** The "Deep Scraping" IP and "Sentiment Engine."
*   **Scenario:**
    *   **$10k ARR:** Too small for M&A. Valuation ~$50k - $100k (Acquire.com flip).
    *   **$100k ARR:** Valuation ~$400k - $800k.
    *   **Goal:** Hit **$500k ARR** for a **$3M - $5M** exit to a strategic buyer.
