## Cold DM Scripts

### LinkedIn DM - Agency Owner

**Subject:** Quick question about [Agency Name]

```
Hey [Name],

I saw [Agency Name] works with some impressive brands. Quick question:

How are you currently tracking what people say about your clients online? 

We built a tool that monitors Reddit, Twitter, HN, and news sites 24/7 and uses AI to flag sentiment issues before they escalate.

Agencies are using it to:
• Catch PR crises early
• Prove ROI to clients with weekly reports
• Monitor competitors

Would a quick demo be useful? It's free during beta.

[Your Name]
```

### Twitter DM - Startup Founder

```
Hey [Name],

Saw you're building [Product]. Congrats on the launch!

Quick heads up: people are definitely talking about you on Reddit/HN. 
Are you tracking those mentions?

I built a free tool that does this + sentiment analysis. 
Happy to give you early access if useful.

[Your Name]
```

### Reddit DM - Solo Consultant

```
Hey [Username],

Noticed your comment in r/marketing about brand monitoring challenges.

I'm building exactly that. Free tool that:
- Monitors Reddit, Twitter, news sites
- AI sentiment analysis
- Slack/Discord alerts

Would love your feedback. Can I add you to the beta?

[Your Name]

### Email - Agency Decision Maker

**Subject:** How [Competitor Agency] caught a PR crisis 6 hours early

```
Hi [Name],

[Competitor Agency] almost had a disaster last month. A negative Reddit thread 
about their client was gaining traction fast.

They caught it in 6 hours instead of 6 days because of automated monitoring.

I'm building BrandTracker — an AI tool that:
✓ Monitors Reddit, Twitter, HN, news sites 24/7
✓ Detects sentiment automatically
✓ Alerts via Slack before things go viral

We're in beta (free access) and looking for agencies to test it.

Would you be open to a 15-min demo?

[Your Name]
Founder, BrandTracker
```

## Objection Handling

### "We already use [Mention, Brandwatch]"
> "Got it. Those are great for enterprise. We're built for speed and cost — 
> 90% cheaper and catches Reddit/HN mentions they often miss. 
> Worth a quick look as a backup?"

### "We don't need this"
> "Totally understand. Just curious — how do you currently find out when 
> someone mentions your brand on Reddit or Hacker News? Most say they check 
> manually or... don't. That's where we help."

### "Who else is using this?"
> "We're in early beta with [X] agencies. Happy to share a case study after 
> you've had a chance to try it."

### "Is my data secure?"
> "Yes — we only index publicly available data. Your account data is encrypted, 
> and we're GDPR compliant. Full privacy policy at brandtracker.io/privacy"
