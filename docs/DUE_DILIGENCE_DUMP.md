# Brand-Mention-Reputation-Tracker


A full-stack brand intelligence platform that ingests live mentions across the web, enriches them with AI, and surfaces insights through a React dashboard. The system is composed of multiple services (API Gateway, Aggregator, Orchestrator, Worker, Shared utilities) tied together via Redis queues and MongoDB, with a Vite + Tailwind frontend. A production deployment can be packaged into a single Docker container that serves the frontend and proxies backend APIs through Nginx.
