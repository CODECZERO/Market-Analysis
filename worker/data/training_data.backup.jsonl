If NO, return { \"relevant\": false }.\n\n**TASK B: INTENT**\nClassify intent: HOT_LEAD, CHURN_RISK, BUG_REPORT, GENERAL.\n\n**TASK C: STRATEGY**\nIf user expresses crisis signals (viral complaint), tag as CRITICAL_ALERT. Otherwise NONE\n\n**OUTPUT JSON:**\n{ \"relevant\": true, \"intent\": \"HOT_LEAD\", \"strategic_tag\": \"NONE\", \"sentiment_score\": 0.5, \"summary\": \"...\" }\n\nJSON:","output_json":"To analyze the given social media text about the brand \"amazon,\" let's break down the tasks step by step.\n\n### TASK A: DISAMBIGUATION\nThe text is clearly about the user's experience with \"amazon,\" specifically regarding an issue they are facing with writing a review due to a message about \"unusual reviewing activity.\" The user mentions their amazon account and interactions with amazon's customer service. Therefore, the text is relevant to \"amazon.\"\n\n```json\n\"relevant\": true\n```\n\n### TASK B: INTENT CLASSIFICATION\nThe user is expressing frustration with a specific issue related to their account and the inability to leave a review. They have tried to contact customer service but have not been able to resolve the issue due to what they perceive as a lack of understanding from the representatives. The intent is not to make a purchase (HOT_LEAD) but to resolve an issue. The user is not directly stating they will leave (CHURN_RISK), nor are they simply praising (PRAISE) or making a general comment (GENERAL). They are reporting a problem (BUG_REPORT) with the review system or their account status.\n\n```json\n\"intent\": \"BUG_REPORT\"\n```\n\nHowever, given the context that the user is a long-standing customer who is now facing issues and is frustrated, there's an underlying risk of churn if the issue isn't resolved properly.\n\n### TASK C: STRATEGY\nThe user is not making a viral complaint but is rather seeking help and explanation for the issue they are facing. They are posting on reddit because they couldn't get a satisfactory response from amazon's customer service. While the post indicates frustration, it doesn't signal an immediate crisis or viral complaint that would necessitate a CRITICAL_ALERT. Thus, the strategic tag should be \"NONE\" for now.\n\n```json\n\"strategic_tag\": \"NONE\"\n```\n\n### Additional Analysis\n- **Sentiment Score**: The sentiment is somewhat negative due to the frustration expressed, but there's also a plea for help, indicating a mix of emotions. Let's score it around -0.5, reflecting the negative sentiment due to frustration.\n\n```json\n\"sentiment_score\": -0.5\n```\n\n- **Summary**: User is frustrated with amazon's review system flagging their first-ever review attempt as \"unusual reviewing activity\" and is seeking help after failing to get a clear explanation from customer service.\n\n```json\n\"summary\": \"User frustrated with amazon review system and customer service response.\"\n```\n\n- **Confidence**: The analysis is based on a clear understanding of the user's issue and sentiment, so confidence is high.\n\n```json\n\"confidence\": 0.9\n```\n\n- **Keywords**: amazon, review, customer service, unusual reviewing activity.\n\n```json\n\"keywords\": [\"amazon\", \"review\", \"customer service\", \"unusual reviewing activity\"]\n```\n\n- **Feature Requests**: None directly mentioned, but there's an implicit request for better customer service understanding and resolution.\n\n```json\n\"feature_requests\": [\"better customer service\"]\n```\n\n- **Pain Points**: Difficulty in getting help from customer service, unclear policies on reviewing activity.\n\n```json\n\"pain_points\": [\"customer service understanding\", \"reviewing activity policy clarity\"]\n```\n\n- **Churn Risks**: Potential loss of customer due to unresolved issue and perceived poor customer service.\n\n```json\n\"churn_risks\": [\"unresolved issue\", \"poor customer service\"]\n```\n\n- **Recommended Actions**: Respond to the user's concern, clarify the reviewing activity policy, and provide a direct resolution to their issue.\n\n```json\n\"recommended_actions\": [\"respond to user concern\", \"clarify reviewing activity policy\"]\n```\n\n- **Lead Score**: Not applicable directly as the intent is not to make a purchase, but the user's loyalty and history with amazon suggest a high value customer. Let's assign a score based on the context of churn risk rather than lead generation.\n\n```json\n\"lead_score\": 0\n```\n\n### Final JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"relevant\": true,\n  \"intent\": \"BUG_REPORT\",\n  \"strategic_tag\": \"NONE\",\n  \"sentiment_score\": -0.5,\n  \"summary\": \"User frustrated with amazon review system and customer service response.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"keywords\": [\"amazon\", \"review\", \"customer service\", \"unusual reviewing activity\"],\n  \"feature_requests\": [\"better customer service\"],\n  \"pain_points\": [\"customer service understanding\", \"reviewing activity policy clarity\"],\n  \"churn_risks\": [\"unresolved issue\", \"poor customer service\"],\n  \"recommended_actions\": [\"respond to user concern\", \"clarify reviewing activity policy\"],\n  \"lead_score\": 0\n}\n```","model_used":"meta/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct","latency_ms":0.0,"metadata":{}}

However, given the context that the user is discussing a specific product issue and not directly criticizing Amazon's services, and considering the detected pattern is \"switching intent,\" we should lean towards understanding if this indicates a potential loss of trust or churn risk due to the product issue.\n\nUpon closer inspection, the intent is more nuanced. The user is detailing a specific issue with a product, which could imply a \"BUG_REPORT\" if we consider the product defect (leaking sprayer, potential fake product). However, the overall sentiment and the fact that it's a product from a subsidiary of Amazon, makes it relevant to Amazon's reputation.\n\n```json\n\"intent\": \"CHURN_RISK\"\n```\n\nBecause the issue is with a product from an Amazon subsidiary and reflects on Amazon's marketplace and brand trust.\n\n### TASK C: STRATEGY\nThe user is not expressing a viral complaint or crisis signal that would immediately suggest a \"CRITICAL_ALERT.\" The issue is contained within a specific product purchase and its authenticity and performance. Thus, it doesn't escalate to a \"CRITICAL_ALERT\" but is still important for Amazon to address to prevent potential churn.\n\n```json\n\"strategic_tag\": \"NONE\"\n```\n\n### Additional Analysis\n- **Sentiment Score**: The sentiment is somewhat negative due to the concerns raised, but not extremely negative as the user is detailing specific issues rather than ranting. Let's assign a sentiment score of `-0.5` due to the negative experience, but it's not extremely low because the user is providing detailed feedback.\n\n```json\n\"sentiment_score\": -0.5\n```\n\n- **Summary**: User bought a potentially counterfeit or defective perfume from Woot.com (an Amazon subsidiary), questioning its authenticity and performance.\n\n```json\n\"summary\": \"User questions authenticity and performance of perfume bought from Woot.com, an Amazon company.\"\n```\n\n- **Confidence**: The analysis is based on clear details provided by the user, so confidence is high.\n\n```json\n\"confidence\": 0.9\n```\n\n- **Keywords**: [\"Woot.com\", \"Amazon\", \"Counterfeit\", \"Product Issue\", \"Authenticity\"]\n\n```json\n\"keywords\": [\"Woot.com\", \"Amazon\", \"Counterfeit\", \"Product Issue\", \"Authenticity\"]\n```\n\n- **Feature Requests**: None directly mentioned.\n\n```json\n\"feature_requests\": []\n```\n\n- **Pain Points**: [\"Potential counterfeit products\", \"Product performance issues\", \"Defective product (leaking sprayer)\"]\n\n```json\n\"pain_points\": [\"Potential counterfeit products\", \"Product performance issues\", \"Defective product (leaking sprayer)\"]\n```\n\n- **Churn Risks**: [\"Loss of trust due to counterfeit or defective products sold through Amazon's subsidiary\"]\n\n```json\n\"churn_risks\": [\"Loss of trust due to counterfeit or defective products sold through Amazon's subsidiary\"]\n```\n\n- **Recommended Actions**: [\"Investigate the product issue and respond to the user's concerns\", \"Ensure Woot.com's product authenticity and quality control\"]\n\n```json\n\"recommended_actions\": [\"Investigate the product issue and respond to the user's concerns\", \"Ensure Woot.com's product authenticity and quality control\"]\n```\n\n- **Lead Score**: Not directly applicable as the user isn't expressing purchase intent from Amazon directly, but it's relevant for customer retention.\n\n```json\n\"lead_score\": 0\n```\n\n### Output JSON\n\n```json\n{\n  \"relevant\": true,\n  \"intent\": \"CHURN_RISK\",\n  \"strategic_tag\": \"NONE\",\n  \"sentiment_score\": -0.5,\n  \"summary\": \"User questions authenticity and performance of perfume bought from Woot.com, an Amazon company.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"keywords\": [\"Woot.com\",","model_used":"meta/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct","latency_ms":0.0,"metadata":{}}

The mention is directly related to the brand \"amazon.\" Therefore, the text is about \"amazon,\" and we conclude that it is relevant.\n\n### TASK B: INTENT\nThe text states, \"disney lorcana whispers in the well illumineer's trove is in stock at amazon for $49.94 (msrp)\" and provides a link to view the current status, indicating that the user is sharing information about a product available on amazon. The tone is informative, and the inclusion of an affiliate link suggests a potential interest in driving traffic or earning a commission, but it also indicates that the product is available for purchase on amazon. The intent here can be seen as related to a potential sale or informing others about a product's availability. Thus, it can be classified as a \"HOT_LEAD\" because it indicates purchase intent or at least interest in a product sold by amazon.\n\n### TASK C: STRATEGY\nThe text does not express any crisis signals or viral complaints about amazon. Instead, it informs about a product's availability. Therefore, it should not be tagged as \"CRITICAL_ALERT\" but rather as \"NONE\" since there's no indication of a crisis or negative sentiment towards amazon.\n\n### OUTPUT JSON\nLet's construct the output JSON based on the analysis:\n\n- **Relevant**: The text is about \"amazon,\" so it's true.\n- **Intent**: The intent is \"HOT_LEAD\" because the text implies a product is available for purchase.\n- **Strategic Tag**: \"NONE\" since there's no crisis signal.\n- **Sentiment Score**: The sentiment is neutral/informative with a slightly positive undertone due to the product being in stock, so a score of 0.5 is reasonable.\n- **Summary**: The user is sharing information about a product available on amazon, indicating its price and availability.\n- **Confidence**: High, as the analysis is based on clear indicators (e.g., product availability, price).\n- **Keywords**: [\"amazon\", \"disney lorcana\", \"in stock\"]\n- **Feature Requests**, **Pain Points**, **Churn Risks**: Not applicable based on the given text.\n- **Recommended Actions**: Potentially, amazon could consider this as an opportunity to engage with the user or monitor affiliate link usage.\n- **Lead Score**: High, because the product is in stock and available for purchase, indicating potential sales.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"relevant\": true,\n  \"intent\": \"HOT_LEAD\",\n  \"strategic_tag\": \"NONE\",\n  \"sentiment_score\": 0.5,\n  \"summary\": \"User shares information about a product being in stock on amazon, indicating its price and availability.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"keywords\": [\"amazon\", \"disney lorcana\", \"in stock\"],\n  \"feature_requests\": [],\n  \"pain_points\": [],\n  \"churn_risks\": [],\n  \"recommended_actions\": [\"Monitor affiliate link engagement\"],\n  \"lead_score\": 80\n}\n```\n\nThis analysis provides insights into the social media text regarding amazon, categorizing it as a \"HOT_LEAD\" with a strategic tag of \"NONE\" and suggesting potential actions based on the information shared.","model_used":"meta/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct","latency_ms":0.0,"metadata":{}}

The user explicitly states they have checked Amazon, indicating that the text is indeed about Amazon.\n\nTherefore, the text is relevant to \"amazon.\"\n\n```json\n\"relevant\": true\n```\n\n### TASK B: INTENT\n\nThe user is inquiring about the availability of a specific product (\"veteran guardsman\") on Amazon and other platforms because they are unable to find it. The intent behind this post is not directly related to purchasing from Amazon at the moment (since the product is out of stock) but is related to a product search. However, it indicates a potential customer's interest and frustration due to unavailability. The closest intent classification would be \"GENERAL\" as the user is not directly expressing dissatisfaction with Amazon's service but is rather inquiring about product availability.\n\nHowever, given the context that the user is checking Amazon and is interested in making a purchase (as indicated by their checking multiple platforms including Amazon), one might argue it leans towards a \"HOT_LEAD\" if we consider the intent as a potential purchase when the product is available. But strictly speaking, the immediate intent is not to buy but to inquire.\n\nLet's classify it as \"GENERAL\" due to the nature of the inquiry.\n\n```json\n\"intent\": \"GENERAL\"\n```\n\n### TASK C: STRATEGY\n\nThe user is not expressing a viral complaint or crisis signal directly towards Amazon; they are more so inquiring about product availability across multiple platforms. Thus, there's no indication of a \"CRITICAL_ALERT.\" The appropriate tag here is \"NONE.\"\n\n```json\n\"strategic_tag\": \"NONE\"\n```\n\n### Sentiment Score, Summary, and Other Fields\n\n- **Sentiment Score**: The sentiment is somewhat neutral with a hint of frustration due to the product being out of stock. Let's assign a sentiment score of 0.2, reflecting a slightly negative sentiment due to the unavailability of the product.\n\n```json\n\"sentiment_score\": 0.2\n```\n\n- **Summary**: User is inquiring about the availability of \"veteran guardsman\" on Amazon and other platforms.\n\n```json\n\"summary\": \"User is inquiring about the availability of 'veteran guardsman' on Amazon and other platforms.\"\n```\n\n- **Confidence**: The analysis is based on the text's content, so a high confidence level is assigned.\n\n```json\n\"confidence\": 0.9\n```\n\n- **Keywords**: [\"veteran guardsman\", \"amazon\", \"out of stock\"]\n\n```json\n\"keywords\": [\"veteran guardsman\", \"amazon\", \"out of stock\"]\n```\n\n- **Feature Requests, Pain Points, Churn Risks, Recommended Actions, Lead Score**:\n  - The user is not directly making a feature request or complaining about a service, so \"feature_requests,\" \"pain_points,\" and \"churn_risks\" are not directly applicable.\n  - A potential \"recommended action\" could be to notify the user when the product is back in stock.\n  - \"Lead Score\" could be considered moderate because the user is actively looking to purchase.\n\n```json\n\"feature_requests\": [],\n\"pain_points\": [\"product unavailability\"],\n\"churn_risks\": [],\n\"recommended_actions\": [\"Notify user when 'veteran guardsman' is back in stock\"],\n\"lead_score\": 60\n```\n\n### Final JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"relevant\": true,\n  \"intent\": \"GENERAL\",\n  \"strategic_tag\": \"NONE\",\n  \"sentiment_score\": 0.2,\n  \"summary\": \"User is inquiring about the availability of 'veteran guardsman' on Amazon and other platforms.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"keywords\": [\"veteran guardsman\", \"amazon\", \"out of stock\"],\n  \"feature_requests\": [],\n  \"pain_points\": [\"product unavailability\"],\n  \"churn_risks\": [],\n  \"recommended_actions\": [\"Notify user when 'veteran guardsman' is back in stock\"],\n  \"lead_score\": 60\n}\n```","model_used":"meta/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct","latency_ms":0.0,"metadata":{}}

The first text discusses a product deal on Amazon, highlighting a discount on a waterproof pet cover for a sofa. The tone is informative, focusing on the price and the availability of free shipping. There's no emotional language used; it's neutral/informative.\n\n2. The second text is about another deal on Amazon, this time for Capri Sun juice drinks. Similar to the first text, it's informative, detailing the price and discounts available. The tone is neutral, aiming to inform about a deal.\n\n3. The third text is a request for help with building a PC, with the user wanting it to be \"future-ready.\" The tone here is inquiring and slightly anticipatory, showing a positive disposition towards the future PC build.\n\n4. The fourth text appears to be a sales pitch for cheap Geometry Dash thumbnails, specifying the price and payment methods. The tone is promotional.\n\n5. The fifth text involves selling vouchers from various services, including Amazon Prime. The tone is transactional.\n\n6. The sixth text informs about the availability of a Disney Lorcana product on Amazon at MSRP. The tone is neutral/informative.\n\n7. The seventh text expresses frustration and disappointment about the unavailability of Warhammer Veteran Guardsman figures across various platforms, including Amazon and local stores. The language used (\"sucks\") indicates a negative sentiment.\n\nNow, calculating the sentiment:\n\n- Texts 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 are neutral/informative or transactional, contributing to a neutral sentiment.\n- Text 3 is slightly positive due to its anticipatory tone regarding a future PC build.\n- Text 7 is negative due to the expressed frustration and disappointment.\n\nLet's assign sentiment scores:\n- Positive sentiment is mainly driven by text 3.\n- Negative sentiment is driven by text 7.\n- Neutral sentiment is driven by texts 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6.\n\nGiven the number of texts and their respective sentiments, we can calculate the overall sentiment as follows:\n\n- Total texts = 7\n- Positive texts = 1 (text 3)\n- Negative texts = 1 (text 7)\n- Neutral texts = 5 (texts 1, 2, 4, 5, 6)\n\nTo simplify, let's directly calculate the sentiment proportions:\n- Positive proportion = 1/7 ≈ 0.143\n- Negative proportion = 1/7 ≈ 0.143\n- Neutral proportion = 5/7 ≈ 0.714\n\nThe sum of these proportions is 1 (0.143 + 0.143 + 0.714 = 1).\n\nHowever, the task requires a JSON output with keys \"positive\", \"negative\", \"neutral\" whose values are floats between 0 and 1 summing to 1. The analysis above directly provides these values.\n\nHere's the JSON output based on the analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"positive\": 0.143,\n  \"negative\": 0.143,\n  \"neutral\": 0.714\n}\n```\n\nTo align with the specified output format which includes additional details, let's enhance it while keeping the core sentiment analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sentiment_score\": 0.285, // Derived from (0.143 * 1) + (0.143 * -1) + (0.714 * 0)\n  \"sentiment_label\": \"neutral\",\n  \"emotions\": { \"joy\": 0.1, \"anger\": 0.1, \"frustration\": 0.1, \"enthusiasm\": 0.1, \"disappointment\": 0.1, \"anxiety\": 0.0 },\n  \"key_drivers\": [\"product availability\", \"pricing\"],\n  \"pain_points\": [\"product unavailability\"],\n  \"feature_requests\": []\n}\n```\n\nHowever, the exact JSON format requested in the prompt focuses on the sentiment proportions. Thus, sticking strictly to the given instructions for the output format related to positive, negative, and neutral sentiment:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"positive\": 0.143,\n  \"negative\": 0.143,\n  \"neutral\": 0.714\n}\n```","model_used":"meta/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct","latency_ms":0.0,"metadata":{}}

The user feels misunderstood and is seeking help or an explanation.\n\nThe second text is about seeking suggestions for a murder mystery party for New Year's Eve and is a positive, enthusiastic inquiry about ideas and experiences.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Sentiment\nFor the first text:\n- The user is frustrated with Amazon's customer service, indicating a negative sentiment.\n- The user is seeking help and is frustrated with the system, which further indicates a negative sentiment.\n- There's a hint of desperation and disappointment.\n\nFor the second text:\n- The user is looking for ideas for a murder mystery party, indicating a positive and enthusiastic sentiment.\n- The text is friendly and inviting, asking for suggestions.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Sentiment Scores\nFor the first text, the sentiment is predominantly negative due to the frustration and issues with customer service. Let's assign a negative score.\n\nFor the second text, the sentiment is positive due to the enthusiastic and friendly tone. Let's assign a positive score.\n\n### Step 4: Generate JSON Output\nTo simplify, we'll directly analyze the sentiment and provide the output in the required format, although the original request was for a different format. The required format is:\n```json\n{\n  \"positive\": float,\n  \"negative\": float,\n  \"neutral\": float\n}\n```\nWhere the floats sum to 1.\n\nFor the first text:\n- The sentiment is negative, so \"negative\" should be high.\n- Let's assign \"negative\": 0.8, \"neutral\": 0.2, \"positive\": 0.0.\n\nFor the second text:\n- The sentiment is positive, so \"positive\" should be high.\n- Let's assign \"positive\": 0.9, \"neutral\": 0.1, \"negative\": 0.0.\n\n### Output\n\n#### For the First Text\n```json\n{\n  \"positive\": 0.0,\n  \"negative\": 0.8,\n  \"neutral\": 0.2\n}\n```\n\n#### For the Second Text\n```json\n{\n  \"positive\": 0.9,\n  \"negative\": 0.0,\n  \"neutral\": 0.1\n}\n```\n\nHowever, to follow the exact instructions and provide a single JSON object as output for the given problem statement isn't directly applicable since we have two separate texts. If we were to analyze them together as a single input, we'd need to consider their combined sentiment.\n\n### Combined Analysis\nThe first text is negative, and the second is positive. Let's analyze them as separate entities as the original problem doesn't explicitly state how to handle multiple texts.\n\nIf we were to average their sentiment (which isn't directly requested but could be a way to handle multiple texts), we'd calculate the average of their positive, negative, and neutral scores.\n\nLet's directly provide the analysis for each text as per the original request.\n\nTo fully comply with the original format request isn't feasible without a clear method to combine the texts' analyses into a single JSON object. However, we can suggest an alternative that fits the original analysis requirements more closely.\n\n### Alternative Output Format (As per original detailed requirements)\nFor the first text:\n```json\n{\n  \"sentiment_score\": -0.8,\n  \"sentiment_label\": \"negative\",\n  \"emotions\": { \"joy\": 0.0, \"anger\": 0.4, \"frustration\": 0.6, \"enthusiasm\": 0.0, \"disappointment\": 0.5, \"anxiety\": 0.2 },\n  \"key_drivers\": [\"customer support\", \"user experience\"],\n  \"pain_points\": [\"unresponsive customer service\", \"account issue\"],\n  \"feature_requests\": []\n}\n```\n\nFor the second text:\n```json\n{\n  \"sentiment_score\": 0.9,\n  \"sentiment_label\": \"positive\",\n  \"emotions\": { \"joy\": 0.8, \"anger\": 0.0, \"frustration\": 0.0, \"enthusiasm\": 0.9, \"disappointment\": 0.0, \"anxiety\": 0.0 },\n  \"key_drivers\": [\"product ideas\"],\n  \"pain_points\": [],\n  \"feature_requests\": [\"murder mystery party ideas\"]\n}\n```","model_used":"meta/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct","latency_ms":0.0,"metadata":{}}

Therefore, the text is relevant to \"google\".\n\n```json\n\"relevant\": true\n```\n\n### TASK B: INTENT CLASSIFICATION\nThe user is discussing a limitation or drawback related to a small screen size, specifically mentioning that \"apps won't render properly\" and referencing \"google maps\" as an example. This indicates a general commentary or complaint rather than a direct expression of intent to buy, churn, report a bug, or praise. However, the context provided mentions \"switching intent\", which implies the user might be considering alternatives due to certain limitations. The text doesn't directly express a strong intent like HOT_LEAD or CHURN_RISK but is more aligned with a general discussion or complaint. Thus, the intent can be classified as GENERAL.\n\n```json\n\"intent\": \"GENERAL\"\n```\n\n### TASK C: STRATEGY\nThe text does not express a viral complaint or crisis signal directly related to \"google\" or its services being bad; it's more of a general observation about small screen sizes and app rendering. Therefore, it doesn't warrant a CRITICAL_ALERT tag. The appropriate tag here is NONE.\n\n```json\n\"strategic_tag\": \"NONE\"\n```\n\n### Sentiment Score and Summary\nThe sentiment of the text is somewhat negative as it discusses a drawback (\"deters any kind of use outside texting\", \"apps won't render properly\"). However, it's not extremely negative since it's more of an observational statement than a complaint. Thus, a sentiment score of -0.5 could be appropriate, reflecting a slightly negative sentiment.\n\n```json\n\"sentiment_score\": -0.5,\n\"summary\": \"User discusses limitations of small screen sizes, mentioning google maps as an example of an app that won't render properly.\"\n```\n\n### Confidence and Keywords\nGiven the context and the text, the confidence in the analysis is relatively high because the text is straightforward. Keywords extracted could be \"small screen\", \"google maps\", \"render properly\".\n\n```json\n\"confidence\": 0.8,\n\"keywords\": [\"small screen\", \"google maps\", \"render properly\"]\n```\n\n### Feature Requests, Pain Points, Churn Risks, Recommended Actions, and Lead Score\n- **Feature Requests**: None directly mentioned.\n- **Pain Points**: \"Small screen size causing apps to not render properly\".\n- **Churn Risks**: Potential dissatisfaction with device or screen size due to app rendering issues.\n- **Recommended Actions**: None directly applicable as this isn't a direct complaint to \"google\".\n- **Lead Score**: 0, as there's no clear intent to purchase or engage with \"google\" or its services directly from the text.\n\n```json\n\"feature_requests\": [],\n\"pain_points\": [\"small screen size causing apps to not render properly\"],\n\"churn_risks\": [\"dissatisfaction with device or screen size\"],\n\"recommended_actions\": [],\n\"lead_score\": 0\n```\n\n### Final JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"relevant\": true,\n  \"intent\": \"GENERAL\",\n  \"strategic_tag\": \"NONE\",\n  \"sentiment_score\": -0.5,\n  \"summary\": \"User discusses limitations of small screen sizes, mentioning google maps as an example of an app that won't render properly.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.8,\n  \"keywords\": [\"small screen\", \"google maps\", \"render properly\"],\n  \"feature_requests\": [],\n  \"pain_points\": [\"small screen size causing apps to not render properly\"],\n  \"churn_risks\": [\"dissatisfaction with device or screen size\"],\n  \"recommended_actions\": [],\n  \"lead_score\": 0\n}\n```","model_used":"meta/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct","latency_ms":0.0,"metadata":{}}

Here, \"google\" is part of the product name \"google meet\", which is a service offered by Google. The mention is not directly about the brand \"google\" in a broad sense but about one of its products. However, since \"google meet\" is a product of Google, we can consider this relevant to the brand \"google\".\n\nThus, the text is related to \"google\" because it mentions \"google meet\". Therefore, { \"relevant\": true }.\n\n### TASK B: INTENT\nThe user is offering a service (online psychological support sessions) and mentions using \"google meet\" among other platforms for video calls. The text does not express any intent related to purchasing or complaining about Google or its services. Instead, it's using \"google meet\" as a tool for their service. The intent here is not directly related to Google's products or services in terms of being a customer or a complainant. However, since the task involves classifying intent and the user is not expressing dissatisfaction or praise directly towards Google, we need to consider the context.\n\nThe intent classification options given are HOT_LEAD, CHURN_RISK, BUG_REPORT, FEATURE_REQUEST, PRAISE, or GENERAL. Since the user is not directly interacting with Google's services as a customer or expressing any feedback about Google, the most appropriate classification isn't directly clear. However, given that the user is utilizing Google Meet for their service, if we were to stretch, it could be seen as a GENERAL mention because it doesn't directly relate to Google's customer intent or feedback.\n\n### TASK C: STRATEGY\nThere's no crisis signal or viral complaint in the text regarding Google or its services. The user is simply using \"google meet\" as a means to conduct their online support sessions. Therefore, the strategic tag should be \"NONE\".\n\n### OUTPUT JSON\nLet's compile the information:\n\n- **Relevant**: true, because it mentions \"google meet\".\n- **Intent**: GENERAL, as it's not directly related to Google's customer feedback or purchase intent.\n- **Strategic Tag**: NONE, since there's no crisis signal.\n- **Sentiment Score**: 0.5 (neutral/positive, as the tone is informative and helpful).\n- **Summary**: The user is offering online psychological support sessions and mentions using \"google meet\" for video calls.\n- **Confidence**: 0.8 (high confidence in the assessment).\n- **Keywords**: [\"google meet\", \"online support\", \"psychological support\"].\n- Other fields like feature_requests, pain_points, churn_risks, recommended_actions, and lead_score are not directly applicable here as the text doesn't express a relevant intent towards Google's services.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"relevant\": true,\n  \"intent\": \"GENERAL\",\n  \"strategic_tag\": \"NONE\",\n  \"sentiment_score\": 0.5,\n  \"summary\": \"User is offering online psychological support sessions and mentions using google meet for video calls.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.8,\n  \"keywords\": [\"google meet\", \"online support\", \"psychological support\"],\n  \"feature_requests\": [],\n  \"pain_points\": [],\n  \"churn_risks\": [],\n  \"recommended_actions\": [],\n  \"lead_score\": 0\n}\n```","model_used":"meta/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct","latency_ms":0.0,"metadata":{}}

The primary concern isn't directly about Google's services or products but rather about a malware issue that affects multiple applications, including Google. However, since \"google\" is mentioned and the issue involves a potential problem that could be related to how Google interacts with other software or systems, we need to assess its relevance.\n\nThe user is discussing a problem that involves Google among other applications, indicating that while Google is not the sole subject, it is related to the issue at hand. Thus, the text is somewhat relevant to \"google\" because it mentions Google and involves a potential issue that could reflect on Google or its interaction with other systems.\n\nTherefore, **\"relevant\": true**.\n\n### TASK B: INTENT\nThe user is expressing frustration and seeking help regarding a virus that causes problems with Google and other applications. The intent is not directly related to purchasing or churning from Google's services but is more about seeking a solution to a technical problem. The user is not directly complaining about Google's service or product but is rather reporting a bug or issue that involves Google among other applications.\n\nGiven the context, the intent is closest to **\"BUG_REPORT\"** because the user is describing a technical issue they are experiencing that involves Google. However, it's worth noting that the issue seems more related to a malware problem rather than a bug within Google's product.\n\n### TASK C: STRATEGY\nThe user's post is not a viral complaint about Google directly but rather a plea for help with a technical issue. While it expresses frustration, it doesn't directly signal a crisis related to Google's reputation that would be considered a **CRITICAL_ALERT**. Thus, the strategic tag should be **\"NONE\"**.\n\n### Additional Analysis for JSON Output\n\n- **sentiment_score**: The sentiment is somewhat negative due to the frustration expressed, but it's more of a desperate plea for help than a complaint against Google. Thus, a **sentiment_score** around **-0.5** could be appropriate, reflecting a negative sentiment due to the frustration and issue at hand.\n  \n- **summary**: \"User reports a malware issue involving Google and other applications, seeking help on Reddit.\"\n\n- **confidence**: Given the analysis, a **confidence** level of **0.8** is reasonable, as the classification is based on a clear understanding of the text's content and intent.\n\n- **keywords**: [\"malware\", \"virus\", \"google\", \"edge\", \"outlook\"]\n\n- **feature_requests**: None, as the user is not requesting a feature.\n\n- **pain_points**: [\"malware issue affecting multiple applications including Google\"]\n\n- **churn_risks**: None directly related to Google's services; the issue is more about the malware.\n\n- **recommended_actions**: [\"Provide technical support or guidance on dealing with malware\"]\n\n- **lead_score**: Not applicable in the traditional sense since the user isn't expressing purchase intent. However, if Google were to offer a solution or support for this issue, it could be seen as an opportunity. Thus, a **lead_score** of **0** might be appropriate.\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"relevant\": true,\n  \"intent\": \"BUG_REPORT\",\n  \"strategic_tag\": \"NONE\",\n  \"sentiment_score\": -0.5,\n  \"summary\": \"User reports a malware issue involving Google and other applications, seeking help on Reddit.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.8,\n  \"keywords\": [\"malware\", \"virus\", \"google\", \"edge\", \"outlook\"],\n  \"feature_requests\": [],\n  \"pain_points\": [\"malware issue affecting multiple applications including Google\"],\n  \"churn_risks\": [],\n  \"recommended_actions\": [\"Provide technical support or guidance on dealing with malware\"],\n  \"lead_score\": 0\n}\n```","model_used":"meta/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct","latency_ms":0.0,"metadata":{}}

It highlights the benefits (low-cost, casual, focused) and the convenience (online, prebook, pay, and meet via WhatsApp or Google Meet).\n\n2. **Sentiment Indicators**:\n   - Positive indicators: \"low-cost\", \"casual\", \"focused\", \"guidance\", \"accountability\", \"without paying high rates\". These suggest a positive sentiment as they highlight the benefits and value proposition of the service.\n   - Neutral indicators: The majority of the text is informational, stating facts about the service (price, duration, platform). This part of the text is neutral as it doesn't inherently carry a positive or negative sentiment.\n\n3. **Emotional Tone**: The tone is professional and helpful, indicating a positive emotional tone. There's an underlying message of support and assistance, which is positive.\n\n4. **Sentiment Calculation**:\n   - The text is predominantly positive due to its emphasis on the benefits and the supportive nature of the service.\n   - There's a significant amount of neutral information (details about the service).\n   - There's no apparent negative sentiment.\n\nGiven these observations, let's assign the sentiment scores. The text is mostly positive and neutral, with a leaning towards being positive due to the beneficial aspects highlighted.\n\n- **Positive Sentiment**: The service is presented in a very favorable light, highlighting its low cost and focused support. Thus, a significant portion of the sentiment is positive.\n- **Neutral Sentiment**: The factual information about the service (price, duration, how to book) contributes to the neutral sentiment.\n- **Negative Sentiment**: There's no negative sentiment expressed.\n\nLet's quantify these observations:\n- Positive: 0.6 (due to the positive descriptors and the beneficial aspects of the service)\n- Neutral: 0.4 (due to the factual, informational content)\n- Negative: 0.0 (since there's no negative sentiment expressed)\n\nThus, the JSON object with the sentiment analysis is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"positive\": 0.6,\n  \"negative\": 0.0,\n  \"neutral\": 0.4\n}\n```\n\nThese values sum to 1 (0.6 + 0.0 + 0.4 = 1), as required.","model_used":"meta/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct","latency_ms":0.0,"metadata":{}}

Although the primary focus is on Lego's new product, \"amazon\" is directly referenced. Therefore, the text is relevant to \"amazon\" because it mentions the brand as a sales channel for the product being discussed.\n\n- **Relevant**: true, because \"amazon\" is mentioned.\n\n### TASK B: INTENT\n\nThe text is discussing a product (Lego Creator 3-in-1 retro gaming console) and mentions that it can be found on Amazon. The tone is informative, highlighting the product's features and price. The intent here seems to be more about informing or showcasing a product available on Amazon rather than expressing dissatisfaction or directly seeking to purchase. However, the mention of the product being available on Amazon and the positive tone towards the product could be seen as generating interest or potential leads.\n\n- **Intent**: HOT_LEAD, because the text is showcasing a product available on Amazon, potentially generating interest.\n\n### TASK C: STRATEGY\n\nThe text does not express any crisis signals or viral complaints about Amazon. It is a neutral/informative piece about a product available on Amazon. Therefore, it does not warrant a CRITICAL_ALERT tag.\n\n- **Strategic Tag**: NONE, as there's no crisis signal.\n\n### Additional Analysis\n\n- **Sentiment Score**: 0.5, because the text has a neutral to slightly positive tone due to the description of the product as \"looks cool\" and the mention of its price as \"$20,\" which could be considered reasonable or attractive.\n\n- **Summary**: The text discusses Lego's new 3-in-1 retro gaming console available on Amazon, among other places, highlighting its price and features.\n\n- **Confidence**: 0.8, because the analysis is based on a clear understanding of the text's content and its implications for Amazon.\n\n- **Keywords**: [\"Lego\", \"retro gaming console\", \"Amazon\", \"$20\"]\n\n- **Feature Requests**: None directly related to Amazon.\n\n- **Pain Points**: None mentioned regarding Amazon.\n\n- **Churn Risks**: None directly related to Amazon.\n\n- **Recommended Actions**: Monitor similar posts for products available on Amazon to understand sales opportunities or product trends.\n\n- **Lead Score**: 60, because while the text doesn't directly indicate a purchase intent from Amazon, it showcases a product available there, potentially generating interest.\n\n### OUTPUT JSON\n\n```json\n{\n  \"relevant\": true,\n  \"intent\": \"HOT_LEAD\",\n  \"strategic_tag\": \"NONE\",\n  \"sentiment_score\": 0.5,\n  \"summary\": \"The text discusses Lego's new 3-in-1 retro gaming console available on Amazon, highlighting its price and features.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.8,\n  \"keywords\": [\"Lego\", \"retro gaming console\", \"Amazon\", \"$20\"],\n  \"feature_requests\": [],\n  \"pain_points\": [],\n  \"churn_risks\": [],\n  \"recommended_actions\": [\"Monitor similar posts for products available on Amazon\"],\n  \"lead_score\": 60\n}\n```","model_used":"meta/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct","latency_ms":0.0,"metadata":{}}

The tone is informative and helpful, indicating a positive or neutral intent rather than a complaint. The user is sharing knowledge about a deal, which can attract potential buyers. This behavior is associated with a \"HOT_LEAD\" because it indicates purchase intent or at least an interest in shopping on Amazon.\n\n### TASK C: STRATEGY\nThere's no expression of crisis signals or viral complaints in the text.

This indicates that the text is indeed related to \"amazon\" because it directly mentions one of Amazon's services, \"Amazon Fresh\". Therefore, the text is relevant to \"amazon\".\n\n### TASK B: INTENT\nThe intent of the post is not directly related to expressing dissatisfaction, reporting a bug, or praising Amazon. Instead, it's about a startup founder looking for a small loan investor. The mention of Amazon is within the context of listing vendors with whom Frootex has established relationships. The primary intent is to seek investment, which can be classified as a business or investment opportunity. However, given the categories, the closest intent related to the context provided would be \"HOT_LEAD\" if we consider the potential for Amazon to be interested in the investment opportunity or the startup's relationship with Amazon Fresh.

Therefore, the text is relevant to \"amazon.\"\n\n```json\n\"relevant\": true\n```\n\n### TASK B: INTENT\nThe user is discussing an issue with their order (receiving the wrong version of a product), but the tone doesn't seem overly negative since they acknowledge the correct version arrived later. The intent here can be classified based on the context and content. The user is not directly expressing dissatisfaction with Amazon's overall service or explicitly stating they are looking for an alternative. However, the issue with the order could be seen as a potential complaint or a report of a problem. The correct classification depends on understanding the nuance of the situation.\n\nGiven that the user received the correct product eventually, the intent is not strongly negative like CHURN_RISK or BUG_REPORT. It's more about reporting an issue that got resolved. However, since the user is discussing a specific transaction and issue, it doesn't fit neatly into GENERAL either. The user is not expressing a clear intent to purchase or switch, but the context is somewhat positive as the issue was resolved.\n\nUpon closer inspection, the intent seems more aligned with reporting an issue (BUG_REPORT) rather than being a hot lead or churning. However, the overall sentiment is not strongly negative.\n\n```json\n\"intent\": \"BUG_REPORT\"\n```\n\n### TASK C: STRATEGY\nThe user is not expressing a viral complaint or crisis signal; they are simply stating a fact about their experience with Amazon. There's no indication that this is going to escalate into a viral issue or that the user is extremely dissatisfied. Therefore, the strategic tag should be \"NONE\".\n\n```json\n\"strategic_tag\": \"NONE\"\n```\n\n### Sentiment Score and Summary\nThe sentiment score is somewhat positive because, despite the initial issue, the correct product was delivered. Let's assign a sentiment score of 0.5, reflecting a neutral to slightly positive sentiment.\n\n```json\n\"sentiment_score\": 0.5,\n\"summary\": \"User received wrong product version from Amazon but received the correct one later.\"\n```\n\n### Additional Analysis\n- **Feature Requests**: None mentioned.\n- **Pain Points**: Receiving the wrong product version.\n- **Churn Risks**: None explicitly mentioned.\n- **Recommended Actions**: Responding to acknowledge the issue and possibly offering a goodwill gesture could be considered, but it's not explicitly necessary here as the issue was resolved.\n- **Lead Score**: Not directly applicable as the user isn't expressing purchase intent.\n\nLet's assign:\n```json\n\"feature_requests\": [],\n\"pain_points\": [\"wrong product version sent\"],\n\"churn_risks\": [],\n\"recommended_actions\": [\"Consider a goodwill gesture for the inconvenience\"],\n\"lead_score\": 0\n```\n\n### Confidence\nThe confidence in this analysis is relatively high because the text is straightforward about the issue and its resolution.\n\n```json\n\"confidence\": 0.8\n```\n\n### Keywords\nExtracted keywords could be \"Amazon\", \"wrong order\", \"4K\", \"Blu-ray\".\n\n```json\n\"keywords\": [\"Amazon\", \"wrong order\", \"4K\", \"Blu-ray\"]\n```\n\n### Final JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"relevant\": true,\n  \"intent\": \"BUG_REPORT\",\n  \"strategic_tag\": \"NONE\",\n  \"sentiment_score\": 0.5,\n  \"summary\": \"User received wrong product version from Amazon but received the correct one later.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.8,\n  \"keywords\": [\"Amazon\", \"wrong order\", \"4K\", \"Blu-ray\"],\n  \"feature_requests\": [],\n  \"pain_points\": [\"wrong product version sent\"],\n  \"churn_risks\": [],\n  \"recommended_actions\": [\"Consider a goodwill gesture for the inconvenience\"],\n  \"lead_score\": 0\n}\n```","model_used":"meta/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct","latency_ms":0.0,"metadata":{}}

Although the context might be sensitive due to the product mentioned, the text is indeed about Amazon. Therefore, the text is relevant to \"amazon.\"\n\n```json\n\"relevant\": true\n```\n\n### TASK B: INTENT\nThe user is expressing a need for a specific product (\"crack pipes\") that they cannot obtain from Amazon due to shipping restrictions to their location. They've tried on Amazon but were unable to complete the purchase. The intent here can be classified as a potential lead or inquiry because the user is looking for an alternative to Amazon for their product needs. The most appropriate intent classification is `HOT_LEAD` since the user is actively seeking a product and is facing an obstacle (shipping restriction) that Amazon can't overcome.\n\n```json\n\"intent\": \"HOT_LEAD\"\n```\n\n### TASK C: STRATEGY\nThe user is not expressing any crisis signals or viral complaints against Amazon. They are simply stating a problem (inability to purchase a specific product due to shipping restrictions) and seeking an alternative. Therefore, the strategic tag should be `NONE` as there's no indication of a crisis or a viral complaint.\n\n```json\n\"strategic_tag\": \"NONE\"\n```\n\n### Additional Analysis\n- **Sentiment Score**: The sentiment is somewhat positive towards the product type (\"crack pipes\") the user is looking for, as they find it \"perfect\" for their needs, but neutral/negative towards Amazon's inability to deliver to their location. Thus, a sentiment score of `0.5` is reasonable, indicating a mixed sentiment.\n  \n```json\n\"sentiment_score\": 0.5\n```\n\n- **Summary**: The user is looking for \"crack pipes\" (used for smoking weed) and can't purchase them from Amazon due to shipping restrictions. They're seeking an alternative source.\n\n```json\n\"summary\": \"User seeking 'crack pipes' for smoking weed, unable to buy from Amazon due to shipping restrictions.\"\n```\n\n- **Confidence**: The analysis is based on a clear understanding of the text, so confidence is high.\n\n```json\n\"confidence\": 0.9\n```\n\n- **Keywords**: [\"crack pipes\", \"amazon\", \"shipping restrictions\"]\n\n```json\n\"keywords\": [\"crack pipes\", \"amazon\", \"shipping restrictions\"]\n```\n\n- **Feature Requests/Pain Points/Churn Risks**: The user is facing a pain point with Amazon's shipping restrictions. There's an implicit feature request for Amazon to reconsider or improve their shipping policies for certain products.\n\n```json\n\"pain_points\": [\"shipping restrictions\"],\n\"feature_requests\": [\"relax shipping restrictions for certain products\"]\n```\n\n- **Recommended Actions**: Amazon could potentially respond by offering alternatives or explaining their shipping policies. However, given the product in question, this might not be feasible or legal.\n\n```json\n\"recommended_actions\": [\"Explain shipping policies\", \"Offer alternatives if possible\"]\n```\n\n- **Lead Score**: While the user is expressing a need, the product in question is sensitive and potentially illegal in many jurisdictions. Thus, the lead score should reflect the potential for a legitimate business opportunity, which in this case is low due to the nature of the product.\n\n```json\n\"lead_score\": 0\n```\n\n### Final JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"relevant\": true,\n  \"intent\": \"HOT_LEAD\",\n  \"strategic_tag\": \"NONE\",\n  \"sentiment_score\": 0.5,\n  \"summary\": \"User seeking 'crack pipes' for smoking weed, unable to buy from Amazon due to shipping restrictions.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"keywords\": [\"crack pipes\", \"amazon\", \"shipping restrictions\"],\n  \"feature_requests\": [\"relax shipping restrictions for certain products\"],\n  \"pain_points\": [\"shipping restrictions\"],\n  \"churn_risks\": [],\n  \"recommended_actions\": [\"Explain shipping policies\", \"Offer alternatives if possible\"],\n  \"lead_score\": 0\n}\n```","model_used":"meta/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct","latency_ms":0.0,"metadata":{}}

It specifically mentions that Jeff Bezos sold 25 million Amazon shares for $5.7 billion.

Although the primary discussion is about the product (Gledopto ESP32 WLED digital LED controller) and its technical issues, the mention of \"amazon listing\" makes it relevant to Amazon.\n\nThus, the text is about \"amazon\" in the context of a product purchase.\n\n```json\n\"relevant\": true\n```\n\n### TASK B: INTENT\nThe user is discussing a product they purchased from Amazon and is experiencing technical difficulties with it. They are seeking help with configuring the product. The text does not directly express dissatisfaction with Amazon itself but rather seeks assistance with a product they've bought.\n\nThe intent is not directly related to purchasing or praising Amazon, nor is it a straightforward complaint (CHURN_RISK) against Amazon. It's more about seeking help with a product, which could be classified under GENERAL or potentially BUG_REPORT if we consider the product's issue as the primary focus.\n\nHowever, given the context that the product was purchased from Amazon and the user is discussing their experience, we can consider it as a GENERAL inquiry or issue related to a product bought from Amazon.\n\nUpon closer inspection, the intent seems more aligned with BUG_REPORT or FEATURE_REQUEST due to the technical nature of the issue. However, the primary intent is to seek help, which is more GENERAL. Since the user is not directly expressing intent to buy or churn, and not directly praising Amazon, and it's not a clear BUG_REPORT or FEATURE_REQUEST against Amazon's service, we lean towards GENERAL.\n\n```json\n\"intent\": \"GENERAL\"\n```\n\n### TASK C: STRATEGY\nThe user is not expressing any viral complaint or crisis signal directly against Amazon; they are discussing a technical issue with a product purchased from Amazon.

Therefore, the text is relevant to \"amazon.\"\n\n```json\n\"relevant\": true\n```\n\n### TASK B: INTENT CLASSIFICATION\nThe user has purchased a product (Qubo tyre inflator) from Amazon and is sharing their review. The review is generally positive, highlighting several benefits of the product, such as its compactness, ease of use, and versatility. Although there's a mention of a con (a situation where the inflator wasn't effective), the overall tone remains positive, and the user concludes that it's a \"must have/keep product.\" The intent here is not to complain or report a bug related to Amazon's service but to share a product review. Since the user has already made a purchase, it's not a HOT_LEAD in the traditional sense of someone looking to buy. However, it's still a positive review that could influence others. The closest intent classification would be GENERAL, as it's a product review rather than a direct expression of intent to purchase from Amazon or a complaint about Amazon's service.\n\n```json\n\"intent\": \"GENERAL\"\n```\n\nHowever, given the context that the product was purchased from Amazon and the review is positive, one might argue it indirectly supports Amazon's service. But strictly speaking, the intent is more about the product review than about Amazon's service directly.\n\n### TASK C: STRATEGY\nThe user does not express any crisis signals or viral complaints about Amazon. The negative comment is about the product's limitation in a specific scenario, not about Amazon's service. Therefore, the strategic tag should be \"NONE.\"\n\n```json\n\"strategic_tag\": \"NONE\"\n```\n\n### Sentiment Score and Summary\nThe sentiment score is positive because the review is generally favorable.

However, for the sake of analysis, let's consider it as a positive reflection on Amazon, so a moderate lead score could be considered for potential future purchases or recommendations.\n\n```json\n\"keywords\": [\"Qubo tyre inflator\", \"Amazon\", \"product review\"],\n\"feature_requests\": [],\n\"pain_points\": [\"product limitation in case of puncture\"],\n\"churn_risks\": [],\n\"recommended_actions\": [\"Use the positive review to enhance Amazon's reputation\"],\n\"lead_score\": 50\n```\n\n### Final JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"relevant\": true,\n  \"intent\": \"GENERAL\",\n  \"strategic_tag\": \"NONE\",\n  \"sentiment_score\": 0.7,\n  \"summary\": \"Positive review of a product purchased from Amazon, highlighting its benefits and a specific limitation.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"keywords\": [\"Qubo tyre inflator\", \"Amazon\", \"product review\"],\n  \"feature_requests\": [],\n  \"pain_points\": [\"product limitation in case of puncture\"],\n  \"churn_risks\": [],\n  \"recommended_actions\": [\"Use the positive review to enhance Amazon's reputation\"],\n  \"lead_score\": 50\n}\n```","model_used":"meta/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct","latency_ms":0.0,"metadata":{}}

The user is seeking advice on whether there's a specific type of cord they should look for. While the primary issue isn't directly with Amazon's service, the user is mentioning Amazon as the source of a product that didn't meet their needs. However, the intent seems more aligned with seeking information rather than expressing dissatisfaction directly with Amazon. Still, the context implies a potential issue with the product sold on Amazon.\n\n- The user is not directly expressing dissatisfaction with Amazon's service but is discussing a related issue.\n- The intent is not directly a \"HOT_LEAD\" as the user isn't expressing intent to buy from Amazon immediately, but it's related to a product purchased from Amazon.\n\nGiven the context, the most appropriate intent classification seems to be \"FEATURE_REQUEST\" or \"GENERAL\" since the user is seeking information. However, since the user is discussing a product issue related to a purchase made on Amazon, it leans more towards being a relevant conversation.

However, the user likes the controller, so it's not entirely negative.

Let's score it 40, considering it's not a direct sales inquiry but an opportunity for engagement.\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"relevant\": true,\n  \"intent\": \"GENERAL\",\n  \"strategic_tag\": \"NONE\",\n  \"sentiment_score\": 0.2,\n  \"summary\": \"User discusses an issue with a product (cord for a wired controller) purchased from Amazon, seeking advice on the type of cord needed.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.8,\n  \"keywords\": [\"amazon\", \"wired controller\", \"cord length\", \"power issue\"],\n  \"feature_requests\": [],\n  \"pain_points\": [\"product not meeting specific needs (cord length and power)\"],\n  \"churn_risks\": [],\n  \"recommended_actions\": [\"Respond with helpful information or direct to relevant support/page\"],\n  \"lead_score\": 40\n}\n```","model_used":"meta/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct","latency_ms":0.0,"metadata":{}}

The intent seems to be more aligned with a complaint or dissatisfaction rather than a direct lead. However, the context provided mentions \"switching intent,\" which could imply the user is considering alternatives due to their negative experience. The primary issue here is the product failure and the refund process, not a direct expression of intent to buy or churn from Amazon's services entirely. The user is more focused on resolving their current issue.\n\nGiven the details:\n- The user is not directly expressing a HOT_LEAD intent as they are not indicating a desire to make a new purchase.\n- The user is expressing dissatisfaction, which could be seen as a CHURN_RISK if they stop using Amazon due to this experience.\n- The issue at hand is a BUG_REPORT or product failure (the NVMe SSD failing).\n- The overall tone is not GENERAL or PRAISE; it's negative.\n\nThe closest intent classification seems to be CHURN_RISK due to the negative experience with both the product and Amazon's customer service. However, since the user is directly complaining about a product issue and the service, it leans more towards a complaint or BUG_REPORT related to the product.\n\nOutput for TASK B: The intent is more closely related to `CHURN_RISK` or `BUG_REPORT`, but given the context and the available options, `CHURN_RISK` seems more appropriate as it reflects the potential loss of customer trust and future business.\n\n### TASK C: STRATEGY\nThe user is expressing frustration with Amazon's handling of their refund and the product failure. While this is a negative experience, there's no clear indication that it's going viral or that the user is actively seeking to create a public crisis. Thus, it doesn't seem to warrant a `CRITICAL_ALERT`. The strategic tag should be `NONE` unless there's a specific reason to believe this complaint will escalate into a viral issue.\n\nHowever, given the detected pattern of \"switching intent,\" there's an opportunity for a competitor to capitalize on Amazon's customer dissatisfaction, which could be tagged as `OPPORTUNITY_TO_STEAL` in a broader strategic context.\n\n### OUTPUT JSON\nLet's compile the information:\n\n- `relevant`: true, as the text is about \"amazon\".\n- `intent`: `CHURN_RISK`, due to the user's negative experience and potential to stop using Amazon.\n- `strategic_tag`: `OPPORTUNITY_TO_STEAL` because the user is dissatisfied and potentially switching, which is an opportunity for competitors.\n- `sentiment_score`: -0.8 (very negative due to the product failure and poor customer service experience).\n- `summary`: \"User bought a third-party NVMe SSD from Amazon, which failed. They're unhappy with Amazon's refund process.\"\n- `confidence`: 0.9 (high confidence due to clear expressions of dissatisfaction).\n- `keywords`: [\"Amazon\", \"NVMe SSD\", \"refund\", \"customer service\", \"failure\"].\n- `feature_requests`: [].\n- `pain_points`: [\"Product failure\", \"Poor customer service\", \"Refund issues\"].\n- `churn_risks`: [\"Product quality\", \"Customer service\"].\n- `recommended_actions`: [\"Respond promptly to the customer's complaint\", \"Offer a resolution or refund\"].\n- `lead_score`: 0 (low, as the user is expressing dissatisfaction rather than purchase intent).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"relevant\": true,\n  \"intent\": \"CHURN_RISK\",\n  \"strategic_tag\": \"OPPORTUNITY_TO_STEAL\",\n  \"sentiment_score\": -0.8,\n  \"summary\": \"User bought a third-party NVMe SSD from Amazon, which failed.

The tone is informative, sharing a deal with potential shoppers. The intent here is to be considered as a \"HOT_LEAD\" because the text is about a product available for purchase on Amazon and is likely to attract buyers.\n\n### TASK C: STRATEGY\nThere's no expression of crisis signals or viral complaints in the text.

It discusses a specific product (4G LTE cellular trail camera) being sold at a discounted price for Prime members. Therefore, the text is indeed about \"amazon.\"\n\n```json\n\"relevant\": true\n```\n\n### TASK B: INTENT\nThe text promotes a deal on amazon for a specific product, indicating a potential purchase or shopping intent. The language used (\"snag this\") suggests enthusiasm and encouragement towards making a purchase, aligning with a \"HOT_LEAD\" intent because it indicates someone is likely to buy or is being encouraged to buy through amazon.\n\n```json\n\"intent\": \"HOT_LEAD\"\n```\n\n### TASK C: STRATEGY\nThe text does not express any crisis signals or viral complaints; instead, it highlights a promotional deal. Therefore, it does not warrant a \"CRITICAL_ALERT\" tag. The appropriate tag here is \"NONE\" as it doesn't indicate a crisis but is a positive mention related to a deal.\n\n```json\n\"strategic_tag\": \"NONE\"\n```\n\n### Additional Analysis for JSON Output\n\n- **Sentiment Score**: The sentiment is positive due to the promotional nature and the excitement around the deal (\"only $34.99 shipped\").

Therefore, the text is relevant to \"amazon\".\n\n```json\n\"relevant\": true\n```\n\n### TASK B: INTENT\nThe text is promoting a deal on a specific product (armaf aura fresh edp spray) available on amazon.com, highlighting the price savings and free shipping options. This indicates a commercial or transactional intent, suggesting that the user is likely looking to make a purchase or is at least interested in the product. The intent here can be classified as \"HOT_LEAD\" because the user is expressing purchase intent by sharing a deal.\n\n```json\n\"intent\": \"HOT_LEAD\"\n```\n\n### TASK C: STRATEGY\nThe text does not express any crisis signals or viral complaints about amazon. Instead, it's sharing a deal and highlighting the benefits of shopping on amazon (e.g., price savings, free shipping). Therefore, it does not warrant a \"CRITICAL_ALERT\" tag. The appropriate strategic tag here is \"NONE\".\n\n```json\n\"strategic_tag\": \"NONE\"\n```\n\n### Additional Analysis for JSON Output\n\n- **Sentiment Score**: The sentiment of the text is generally positive as it highlights savings and free shipping, indicating a positive experience or expectation with amazon.

However, the primary intent here appears to be informational/shopping-related rather than expressing dissatisfaction or a complaint about Amazon.

To calculate the sentiment score, we will assess the overall tone of these texts.\n\n### Sentiment Analysis\n\n1. **Positive Sentiment**: Many of the texts are related to deals, discounts, and product recommendations on Amazon, which generally have a positive tone. For example, posts about discounted prices, free shipping, and product suggestions are prevalent.\n\n2. **Neutral Sentiment**: Some texts are neutral, as they simply provide information or ask questions without expressing a clear positive or negative emotion. Examples include inquiries about product recommendations, discussions about organizing spices, and informational posts about tech billionaires.\n\n3. **Negative Sentiment**: A few texts contain negative sentiment. For instance, there's a discussion criticizing the US government's actions and suggesting a boycott of American products, including Amazon. Another example is a complaint about receiving the wrong Blu-ray version.\n\n### Calculating Sentiment Scores\n\nTo simplify, let's categorize the sentiment based on the overall content:\n\n- **Positive**: Deals, product recommendations, and enthusiastic language contribute to a positive sentiment.\n- **Neutral**: Informational posts, questions, and neutral statements contribute to a neutral sentiment.\n- **Negative**: Criticisms, complaints, and negative discussions contribute to a negative sentiment.\n\nUpon reviewing the texts, it's clear that the majority are related to deals and product discussions, which are generally positive or neutral. There are some negative sentiments, but they are less prevalent.\n\n### Sentiment Score Calculation\n\nLet's assign a rough estimate based on the observed sentiment:\n\n- Positive sentiment is observed in deal posts and product recommendations.\n- Neutral sentiment is seen in informational posts and questions.\n- Negative sentiment is present in criticisms and complaints.\n\nAssuming the positive sentiment is around 60% due to the numerous deal posts and product recommendations, the neutral sentiment is about 30% due to informational content, and the negative sentiment is around 10% due to criticisms and complaints.\n\nThus, the sentiment scores could be approximated as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"positive\": 0.6,\n  \"neutral\": 0.3,\n  \"negative\": 0.1\n}\n```\n\nThese scores sum to 1, as required.\n\n### Detailed Sentiment Analysis as per the Required Output Format\n\nTo provide a more detailed analysis in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sentiment_score\": 0.5,\n  \"sentiment_label\": \"positive\",\n  \"emotions\": {\n    \"joy\": 0.4,\n    \"anger\": 0.1,\n    \"frustration\": 0.05,\n    \"enthusiasm\": 0.3,\n    \"disappointment\": 0.05,\n    \"anxiety\": 0.1\n  },\n  \"key_drivers\": [\"pricing\", \"product quality\"],\n  \"pain_points\": [\"shipping issues\", \"product availability\"],\n  \"feature_requests\": [\"more product options\"]\n}\n```\n\nHowever, the exact values for the detailed analysis would depend on a more nuanced understanding of the text content, including the specific emotions and drivers mentioned.\n\nFor the simplified output as requested:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"positive\": 0.6,\n  \"negative\": 0.1,\n  \"neutral\": 0.3\n}\n```","model_used":"meta/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct","latency_ms":0.0,"metadata":{}}

Although the primary subject isn't directly \"google\", the discussion revolves around google's services and their impact. Thus, the text is relevant to \"google\".\n\n```json\n\"relevant\": true\n```\n\n### TASK B: INTENT\n\nThe text doesn't directly express a purchase intent or dissatisfaction with \"google\" itself. Instead, it discusses a historical scenario involving \"google\" services and their availability on different mobile platforms. The tone is more analytical and comparative, discussing the competitive landscape between Microsoft and Apple (iPhone). The intent is not directly related to a lead, churn risk, bug report, or praise for \"google\". Therefore, it can be classified as GENERAL.\n\n```json\n\"intent\": \"GENERAL\"\n```\n\n### TASK C: STRATEGY\n\nThe text doesn't express any crisis signals or viral complaints about \"google\".

Thus, the strategic tag should be NONE.\n\n```json\n\"strategic_tag\": \"NONE\"\n```\n\n### Sentiment Score, Summary, and Other Fields\n\n- **Sentiment Score**: The sentiment is somewhat neutral with a slightly positive undertone towards \"google\" because it implies that having access to \"google-owned stuff\" was a significant advantage for iPhone.

The user is utilizing Google as a search engine, indicating the text is indeed about the brand \"google\" in the context of its search functionality. Therefore, the text is relevant to \"google\".\n\n### TASK B: INTENT\nThe user is expressing a need or a query (\"is there a way to build neural superchargers+sleep accelerators\") and has used Google to search for it. The intent here is not directly related to purchasing Google's products or services but is more about seeking information. However, the user is not expressing dissatisfaction with Google directly; they're simply using it as a tool for their search. The intent can be seen as GENERAL because the user is not directly praising, complaining, or requesting a feature from Google, nor are they indicating a churn risk or a bug report. They are, however, expressing a need that isn't being met by their current search results, which could be interpreted as a potential lead if Google had a product or service that could fulfill this need (e.g., a more advanced search feature or a related product).\n\n### TASK C: STRATEGY\nThe user is not expressing any crisis signals or viral complaints about Google. The tone is more inquisitive and slightly frustrated due to not finding what they're looking for, but this frustration is not directed at Google specifically.

Here, \"google\" is used as a verb, indicating the act of searching for information using the Google search engine. The issue being discussed is related to Unity, a game engine developed by Unity Technologies, and the user's frustration with troubleshooting a specific error. The text is not directly about the brand \"Google\" as a product or service being complained about or praised; it's about using Google as a search tool.\n\nGiven this context, the relevance to the brand \"Google\" is indirect because the user is mentioning using Google to search for solutions. However, the primary issue is with Unity, not Google. Therefore, the text is not directly relevant to Google as a brand in terms of product or service satisfaction.\n\n### TASK B: INTENT\nThe user is expressing a problem they are facing with Unity and is seeking a solution. They have tried troubleshooting steps and are looking for help. The intent is not directly related to Google's products or services but is more about seeking assistance with a Unity issue. However, if we were to classify the intent based on the context of seeking help and potentially being directed to an alternative solution or support, it could be seen as a \"BUG_REPORT\" or \"GENERAL\" inquiry. Since the user is not directly interacting with Google's products or services, but rather using Google as a search engine, the most fitting classification based on the given options and the context of Google being a brand would be \"GENERAL\" due to the lack of direct relevance.\n\n### TASK C: STRATEGY\nThe user is not expressing a viral complaint directly about Google; they are frustrated with an issue related to Unity. Therefore, there's no \"CRITICAL_ALERT\" here. The strategic tag should be \"NONE\".\n\n### OUTPUT JSON\nGiven the analysis:\n\n- **Relevant**: The text is not directly about Google; it's about Unity.

They mention that their searches on Pinterest and Google haven't yielded satisfactory results. The intent is not directly related to purchasing a Google product or service but is using Google as a tool for searching. However, the user's expression of needing help and not finding it through Google's search functionality could be seen as an opportunity for Google to improve its search results or related services (like Google Images). The intent here can be classified as GENERAL because the user isn't directly expressing dissatisfaction with Google's service quality but is rather using it for a specific need that isn't being met.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, the user's situation and the fact that they're seeking specific solutions that aren't readily available through Google's search could imply a potential lead if Google were to offer tattoo cover-up or design services, or even improve its search functionality for such niche needs.

The text is not directly about the brand \"Google\" but rather uses the brand name as a verb. However, given the context that the brand type is MY_CLIENT and the brand is \"google\", we need to assess if the mention is relevant.\n\nSince \"google\" is being used as a verb and not directly referring to the brand or its services, one might argue it's not directly about the brand.

However, the primary topic of the post is about a VHS tape and seeking information about it. The mention of \"google gemini\" is in the context of using a Google service (likely Gemini, an AI model) to gather information. Thus, the text is tangentially related to \"google\" but not directly about the brand or its products in a manner that indicates a customer issue or praise.\n\nGiven this context, we need to assess if the mention is relevant to our analysis. Since the user is utilizing a Google service (Gemini), it is somewhat relevant.\n\n### TASK B: INTENT\nThe user is not directly expressing purchase intent, dissatisfaction, or a feature request related to Google's products or services. They are using Google Gemini as a tool for information. The intent here seems more aligned with seeking information rather than interacting with Google as a product or service. Thus, the intent is not directly related to Google's business in a way that suggests a lead, churn risk, bug report, or feature request.\n\nHowever, since the user is utilizing Google's service (Gemini) and seems satisfied enough to continue using it (as indicated by the lack of negative sentiment towards Google), we can consider this a GENERAL intent, as it doesn't fit into the other categories directly.\n\n### TASK C: STRATEGY\nThere's no crisis signal or viral complaint in the text. The tone is inquisitive and somewhat casual (\"lol\"), indicating a neutral to positive sentiment towards Google Gemini. Thus, the strategic tag should be \"NONE\".\n\n### OUTPUT JSON\nLet's compile the information:\n\n- **Relevant**: The text is relevant because it mentions the use of a Google service.\n- **Intent**: GENERAL, as the user is using Google Gemini for information.\n- **Strategic Tag**: NONE, because there's no crisis signal.\n- **Sentiment Score**: 0.5, reflecting a neutral to slightly positive sentiment (the user is amused and using the service).\n- **Summary**: User utilizes Google Gemini to gather information about a VHS tape, indicating the service is being used for informational purposes.\n- **Confidence**: 0.8, as the analysis is based on a clear understanding of the text's context and content.\n- **Keywords**: [\"Google Gemini\", \"VHS\", \"information seeking\"].\n- Given the nature of the text, **feature_requests**, **pain_points**, and **churn_risks** are not directly applicable.\n- **Recommended Actions**: None directly related to Google's business, but monitoring such usage can provide insights into how Google's services are being utilized.\n- **Lead Score**: 0, as there's no direct purchase intent or dissatisfaction expressed towards Google.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"relevant\": true,\n  \"intent\": \"GENERAL\",\n  \"strategic_tag\": \"NONE\",\n  \"sentiment_score\": 0.5,\n  \"summary\": \"User uses Google Gemini to gather information about a VHS tape.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.8,\n  \"keywords\": [\"Google Gemini\", \"VHS\", \"information seeking\"],\n  \"feature_requests\": [],\n  \"pain_points\": [],\n  \"churn_risks\": [],\n  \"recommended_actions\": [],\n  \"lead_score\": 0\n}\n```","model_used":"meta/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct","latency_ms":0.0,"metadata":{}}

The mention of \"google\" is related to a specific Google product (Google Forms), not directly about the brand \"google\" in a way that expresses a sentiment or intent towards Google as a company or its main services. However, since it's about a Google product, it can be considered somewhat relevant.\n\n### TASK B: INTENT\nThe text is explaining how a particular feature of \"mentor meter\" works, specifically how it integrates with Google Forms for requesting a professor. There's no clear intent related to Google's products or services being the main subject; it's more about the functionality of another service that uses Google Forms. The intent here seems to be informational or explanatory rather than expressing a lead, risk, bug, or praise directly towards Google.\n\n### TASK C: STRATEGY\nThere's no crisis signal or viral complaint in the text. The tone is informative and helpful.\n\n### Analysis\n- **Relevance**: The text is not directly about \"google\" as a brand but mentions a Google product (Google Forms). Thus, it's somewhat relevant but not directly related to Google's brand reputation or competitive positioning in a significant way.\n- **Intent**: The intent is GENERAL as it's more about explaining a feature of another service rather than expressing a specific intent towards Google.\n- **Strategic Tag**: Since there's no crisis signal or viral complaint, the strategic tag should be \"NONE\".\n\n### Output JSON\nGiven the analysis, the output JSON should reflect that the text is not directly relevant to the brand \"google\" in a significant way but is somewhat related due to the mention of a Google product.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"relevant\": false,\n  \"intent\": \"GENERAL\",\n  \"strategic_tag\": \"NONE\",\n  \"sentiment_score\": 0.0,\n  \"summary\": \"The text is about 'mentor meter', a professor review website that uses Google Forms.

However, the primary focus of the text is not on Google or its services but rather on a personal relationship issue. The mention of \"google doc\" is incidental, used as a means to describe how the couple maintained contact.\n\nGiven this context, the relevance of the text to \"google\" as a brand is low because it's not directly about Google or its services. The mention of \"google doc\" is tangential to the main narrative.\n\nTherefore, for TASK A, the determination is that the text is not directly about \"google\" in a meaningful way related to the brand or its services.\n\n### TASK B: INTENT\nSince the text is not about Google or its services, classifying the intent in terms of HOT_LEAD, CHURN_RISK, BUG_REPORT, FEATURE_REQUEST, PRAISE, or GENERAL is not directly applicable. However, if we were to force a classification based on the content, it would be GENERAL because it doesn't express a specific intent related to Google's products or services.\n\n### TASK C: STRATEGY\nThe text does not express any crisis signals related to Google or its services.

after only dating for 3 months. he was blocked on everything, and i fell into a deep depression. during that dark time, will and i tried our best to stay in contact through our school-issued chromebooks with a google doc, and we made it work. he told me he loved me and we'd get through this. he became my will to live. we weren't allowed to be in contact again until an entire year later. we came back stronger than ever, our love more passionate. he was clingy and sweet and told me often that i'm his everything and that he's going to marry me someday. i believed him because i felt the same. we started planning for fun. a list of baby names, future pets, where we'd want to live, what our honeymoon location would be, all of it. we even decided to attend the same college. i had big ambitions of going to mit, but i settled for a less-popular college because it was will's best option and a guaranteed acceptance. in high school, he was not as academically ambitious as me and was insecure over his standing in more competitive colleges. that was one of the first of many sacrifices i'd make in our relationship. when it was time for us to attend college, we were so excited. we had been counting down the days until moving in. once we moved in, we had never been closer. we were both clingy and affectionate and happy, and i spent every chance i could with him. although he spent a lot of time with others, i didn't mind. i'm not the jealous type. then trouble started happening in paradise. it started small, flashes of emotional immaturity over how i felt about small things, then, when our relationship went through what all relationships go through, the communication period, he was unwilling. i did everything i could, i looked into the best ways to show active listening, how to not emotionally react to things so i wouldn't upset him, making lists of \"boundaries, wants, and needs\" and asked him to do the same, so we could come together and openly communicate and move past any bumps we had. everything. but he would fight, he'd tell me my open communication, my \"when you do \\_ i feel \\_\" statements were overly emotional and made him not want to communicate. eventually, our relationship got so tense that a simple disagreement about a pair of stockings i wanted to buy turned into a heated text conversation where i was honest. i told him i felt like he didn't care about any of my wants, needs, boundaries, or emotions. he dumped me over text during the conversation. i asked him repeatedly if this was what he wanted, and he went through with it. an hour later, he came down to my dorm room and cried. after that, i saw that he wasn't in a good headspace and he needed some peace and time to think. so i proposed a week-long break, just some time to breathe and collect himself and do some self-growth. i told him i'd work on myself, too, so we could be better together. i started journaling, spending time doing things i love, and making friends. i was dealing with a lot of insecurities after he dumped me. i felt that our relationship was unstable, and it planted a seed of anxiety in my heart that blossomed into ugly flowers of distrust. i told him upfront during our conversation at the one-week mark that it'll take time for me to trust him again, that i feared that he didn't love me as i loved him because i'd never once even thought of dumping him, and i told him of my nightmares. constant nightmares of him cheating on me, abandoning me, everything i feared. **i told him only time could heal that, but i still loved him enough to stay, but if he dumped me again, it'd stay that way**. he agreed and got back together with me. we had frequent emotional conversations after that. it didn't help that i eventually found out that while i was pretty much never invited into his dorm room (he hung out in mine even though my roommate was in there all the time, and it was much smaller than his), one of his dormmates' new girlfriend of only two months was sleeping over almost every night. i only found this out because he let it slip once in conversation that *he was falling asleep chem because the girl and his roommate stayed up late watching a movie* (**keep this in mind, it's important later)**. i'd never met the girl, but she was constantly brought up by will. i know her job, her height, her \"cute\" taste in music, her \"cute\" accent, and even what her dorm is like. once, will gushed about her in front of my roommate, and i have never been more embarrassed in my entire life. i eventually confronted will about it all, and he agreed that he sees how he talked about her was odd from an outsider perspective, but that's as far as he listened. when i told him i wasn't comfortable with her spending more time with him than i ever have and sleeping in the one-bedroom dorm he lives in almost every night, while i was only allowed up there a total of 3 times the semester, all while it was empty because he wanted sexual favors, i felt crushed. he told me it's not intimate to sleep in the same room as a girl every night and avoided the questions about why i was never even invited. i'd eventually find out that he'd tag along with her and his roommate to target and barnes and noble in the car she drove, helped her fix things in her dorm, and partook in a community event in my dorm building that i lived in, and i was never invited or even told. while i was constantly bombarded with questions every time i did anything he wasn't a part of. i quit trying to talk to him about my feelings on the subject of his dormmate situation because he either avoided it or said he's fine with it, and that's what matters. another problem that i noticed was will was in constant contact with his mother, like constant. she called 2-3 times a day and texted every other minute. just 2 days after getting back together after our week long break i heard is mom on the phone with him say \"how's your break going with op?\" in a tone that put me on edge. i asked will if he told his mom the reason we were on break, that he dumped me over text, he said he \"didn't recall\". i didn't push further but that went in the back of my mind. things started to seem like they were getting better. will seemed to have matured a bit; he was listening to me a bit more than he used to, and he was still affectionate and clingy with me. we had many sleepovers when my roommate was out of town, we went on date nights that he happily paid for because he \"loves providing\", everything was getting better. my fears were slowly washing away; we were healing. but as the end of our freshman semester came, so did trouble. while i was getting very busy studying for my many finals and working on my projects as an engineering major, i assumed will was doing the same. but when we eventually were able to spend time together, he told me he was failing 2 of his 6 classes. he said his parents were going to be so upset with him. i told him i was disappointed in him too, we had one class together and sat together in the lecture hall. i noticed that while i was taking notes or working on related homework, he was on his gaming laptop playing odd steam games, then he'd complain about his scores on quizzes while i'd coordinate with him to meet me at computer labs before the day of quizzes to study. and when we'd hang in my dorm sometimes i'd take breaks to do homework while he'd sit on reels or some mobile game. after i told him \"i am disappointed in you, you are a smart man but you aren't showing it\" something in his face twisted, something i didn't recognize. later we'd go out on a date and he had me pay for our transportation, i was willing but knew that this was new in our relationship. during the date an intense depression hit me and i shut down completely. i still dont know what it was (maybe a gut feeling) but it made me distant and silent all night. will noticed and tried to comfort me. the next day we spent together since classes were over. i was supposed to go home after finals, but decided to stay until will's finals were over to spend more time with him. his last final was in a class he already failed so he didn't need to study. we spent the day getting sweets, played video games and got intimate. he spent the night and then the next day we spent it together and had so much fun and played those silly couples quizzes on instagram until he had to leave to go to his dorm to sleep so he could go to his early final in the morning. *he seemed so loving that night, what changed?* that morning he had his final then came to my dorm like we discussed the night before so he could help me pack for winter break and then we'd leave that afternoon. but when he came down to my dorm, something was off. he wouldn't look me in the eye, and under is arm he had the hand-made gift i made him for his birthday. an embroidery of a baby, symbollic of our future we'd planned together. i asked him why he brought it down, he said he \"had nowhere to hang it\". i asked him if it upset him and he cried where he sat and said \"no, i love it, it's beautiful, i want to have babies with you\". so i thought he was just a little emotional like i was, i hate leaving his side, it reminds me of the forceful year of separation my parents put on me. so i held him, kissed his face and comforted him. then i had to get up and keep packing but i talked to him the entire time, talking about how i wanted him to meet my grandparents that were coming for the holidays, how i'm so excited to give him his gifts, etc. he was sitting still, just saying \"sure\" to whatever i said. then he asked me a question: \"*why do you think i didn't perform well academically in the second half of the semester?\"*. i was honest, and i told him he didn't take it seriously enough and treated it like high school. he just hummed. then his dad called and told him that he was outside and will told him he'd \"be down in 5 minutes\". we walked to the door, and i met him there to give him a goodbye hug and kiss, and i saw something in his eyes that stayed as i told him i loved him. he then said to me that the reason he didn't do well academically was because of the stress this relationship caused on him. i asked him if it's my fault, he said \"no, i did this to myself, *this stress is from the things i've done*\". i reassured him that we are okay, that time is healing the scars he left on me and he raised his voice at me saying \"is it really!?\" i said yes, kept rubbing his chest and telling him i loved him and that it's okay. he seemed to calm down and i gave him another goodbye kiss and i joked *\"phew, for a second i thought you were going to dump me. don't you dare try to dump me over break, mister*\" as i poked his chest. he put his hand to his face and said \"i'm going to puke\" and turned from me, i rubbed his back and asked if he's okay, then he turned to face me and told me something. it was all a blur, but he said something round-about dumping me so i asked him, \"are you dumping me?\" my eyes already watering. i looked down at the floor when he said yes. i grabbed the door knob to get him out but asked him once, not looking up \"are your sure?\", just like i did the first time he dumped me. he said yes and i walked away and he left without another word. i left for break 3 minutes later, my mom told me she bumped into will on the way out and asked me if everything was alright. i had to tell her he dumped me right before break. the car ride home was difficult. after that i initially made excuses for him. that he made a mistake, that i should forgive him and give him another chance, but now i think it's best to never get back together. i told him before that if he dumped me again i wouldn't take him back, he knew that, i asked if he's sure, he said yes. he dumped me 2 minutes before leaving, was it intentionally manipulative? why would our relationship be the reason for his poor academics when his behavior in class, his lack of effort outside of class, and the fact that his roommate and his roommate's girlfriend were ruining his sleep schedule which was actively impacting his performance in class? is he worth sticking it out for? am i doing the right thing by not taking him back? we've been no contact for 3 weeks now, he removed me on everything but my mom said she saw him at church looking for me the same week he dumped me when i wasn't there. it seems he plans on coming back to me again, i don't know what to do. he's my first kiss, first time, first boyfriend, i loved him but he's hurt me so much.\n\nReturn ONLY valid JSON with this structure:\n{\n    \"sales_intent\": true/false,\n    \"confidence\": 0.0-1.0,\n

However, it's clear that the user is not discussing the brand \"Google\" itself but rather using it as a verb or referring to the act of searching online, likely with Google's search engine. The text is not directly about the brand \"Google\" or its products/services in a manner that suggests feedback, complaint, or praise directly towards Google.\n\nGiven this, the relevance to the brand \"Google\" is indirect. The user is using Google (or a search engine, by implication) to search for something, but the discussion is not about Google itself.\n\nThus, for the purpose of this analysis and based on the instructions, we consider it not directly relevant to the brand \"Google\" as it's more about the user's intent and action of searching.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"relevant\": false\n}\n```\n\nHowever, if we were to analyze it as if it were relevant, let's proceed with the rest of the tasks for educational purposes.\n\n### TASK B: INTENT\nThe user is expressing a need and is looking for recommendations.

They are exploring alternatives, such as Home Assistant, and seeking advice from others with similar experiences. The user is not directly complaining about Google or its services but is rather looking for a solution to their current problem, which involves Google Home. The intent seems to be more about seeking a solution or alternative rather than directly praising or complaining about Google. However, the fact that they are discussing an alternative to Google Home's functionality and are considering other options indicates a potential churn risk or at least a dissatisfaction with the current product. The text doesn't directly indicate a purchase intent for Google products but shows dissatisfaction, which could be categorized under CHURN_RISK or FEATURE_REQUEST due to the specific mention of limitations with Google Home.\n\nHowever, given the context that the user is discussing a competitor's product (Home Assistant) as an alternative and is weighing the costs and complexities, it can be seen as an opportunity for Google to potentially address the user's concerns or provide a better solution. Thus, categorizing it as a HOT_LEAD might be a stretch without direct purchase intent, but it could be considered due to the expressed dissatisfaction and exploration of alternatives.\n\nUpon closer inspection, the intent is more aligned with FEATURE_REQUEST because the user is highlighting a specific limitation (\"limited, annoying control of light colors\") with Google Home.\n\n```json\n\"intent\": \"FEATURE_REQUEST\"\n```\n\n### TASK C: STRATEGY\nThe user is not expressing a viral complaint or crisis signal; they are simply seeking advice and discussing their experience with Google Home among other technologies.

Thus, a sentiment score around 0.0 to -0.5 could be reasonable, reflecting a slightly negative tone.\n\n```json\n\"sentiment_score\": -0.3\n```\n\n- **Summary**: The user is frustrated with Google Home's limited control over light colors and is exploring alternatives like Home Assistant.

Thus, the mention of \"google\" is incidental and not the main subject of the post.\n\nGiven this context, the relevance of the post to the brand \"google\" as MY_CLIENT is low because the post is not directly discussing Google's products or services.

Otherwise NONE\n\n**OUTPUT JSON:**\n{ \"relevant\": true, \"intent\": \"HOT_LEAD\", \"strategic_tag\": \"NONE\", \"sentiment_score\": 0.5, \"summary\": \"...\" }\n\nJSON:","output_json":"To analyze the given social media text about the brand \"google\", let's break down the tasks step by step.\n\n### TASK A: DISAMBIGUATION\nThe text mentions \"google tv streamer 4k\", which is a product related to Google. Therefore, the text is relevant to \"google\".\n\n```json\n\"relevant\": true\n```\n\n### TASK B: INTENT CLASSIFICATION\nThe user is expressing a specific issue with their Google TV Streamer 4k, related to its functionality with their soundbar. They are seeking help or advice from others who might have experienced a similar issue. The user has already purchased the product, so it's not a pre-purchase inquiry. The intent is not directly related to praising the product or making a general comment. The issue described could be classified as a bug report or a feature request due to the user's dissatisfaction with the current functionality (IR control limitation).\n\nHowever, given the context that the user is discussing a specific technical issue with the product and seeking advice, and considering the available intent categories, the most appropriate classification is \"BUG_REPORT\" or potentially \"FEATURE_REQUEST\" if we interpret the user's issue as a request for better CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) functionality. But since the user is directly experiencing an issue with the product's current functionality, \"BUG_REPORT\" seems more fitting. Yet, the provided output format suggests \"HOT_LEAD\" as a possible intent, which might not directly apply here as the user isn't expressing a clear intent to purchase or switch to a different product from Google; they're discussing an issue with an existing product.\n\nUpon closer inspection, while the user is not directly expressing dissatisfaction with Google as a brand or indicating a clear intent to churn or purchase another product from Google, the issue at hand relates to a product they've purchased. The closest intent from the given options, considering the context of \"switching intent\" detected pattern, might be misinterpreted. However, the actual intent seems more aligned with troubleshooting or reporting an issue.\n\nLet's classify it as \"BUG_REPORT\" due to the technical issue being discussed.\n\n### TASK C: STRATEGY\nThe user is not expressing a viral complaint or crisis signal that would necessitate a \"CRITICAL_ALERT\". The issue is contained within a specific community (reddit) and is more of a support or troubleshooting query rather than a public outcry or negative review that could go viral. Therefore, the strategic tag should be \"NONE\".\n\n### OUTPUT JSON\nLet's compile the information:\n\n- **Relevant**: Yes, the text is about a Google product.\n- **Intent**: The user is reporting a bug or issue, so \"BUG_REPORT\".\n- **Strategic Tag**: \"NONE\" since there's no crisis signal.\n- **Sentiment Score**: The sentiment is somewhat negative due to the issue being reported, but the tone is inquiring rather than angry, so a moderate score like 0.0 or slightly negative could be considered. However, given the available information and the fact that the user is seeking help, a score of -0.2 is reasonable to reflect a slightly negative sentiment due to the issue.\n- **Summary**: User is experiencing issues with Google TV Streamer 4k's IR control functionality with their Samsung soundbar and is seeking advice.\n- **Confidence**: High, as the analysis directly relates to the content of the text.\n- **Keywords**: [\"Google TV Streamer 4k\", \"IR control\", \"Samsung soundbar\"]\n- **Feature Requests**: None directly, but implies a need for better CEC functionality or troubleshooting.\n- **Pain Points**: [\"IR control limitation\", \"CEC not working as expected\"]\n- **Churn Risks**: [\"Technical issues not resolved\"]\n- **Recommended Actions**: [\"Provide troubleshooting steps or link to support page\"]\n- **Lead Score**: Not directly applicable as the user isn't expressing purchase intent; however, if we consider the context of \"switching intent\" and the fact that the user is already a customer, a score reflecting potential for future engagement or support could be considered. Let's assign a low score, e.g., 20, as it's not a direct sales lead.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"relevant\": true,\n  \"intent\": \"BUG_REPORT\",\n  \"strategic_tag\": \"NONE\",\n  \"sentiment_score\": -0.2,\n  \"summary\": \"User is experiencing technical issues with Google TV Streamer 4k's IR control and CEC functionality with their Samsung soundbar.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"keywords\": [\"Google TV Streamer 4k\", \"IR control\", \"Samsung soundbar\"],\n  \"feature_requests\": [\"Better CEC functionality\"],\n  \"pain_points\": [\"IR control limitation\", \"CEC not working as expected\"],\n  \"churn_risks\": [\"Technical issues not resolved\"],\n  \"recommended_actions\": [\"Provide troubleshooting steps or link to support page\"],\n  \"lead_score\": 20\n}\n```\n\nThis analysis provides a detailed breakdown of the user's concern and suggests a course of action for Google to address the technical","model_used":"meta/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct","latency_ms":0.0,"metadata":{}}

Thus, the text is relevant to \"Google.\"\n\n### Step 2: Intent Classification (Task B)\nThe user is taking a course on data analytics from Coursera that involves Google (likely Google Data Analytics tools or related topics), and mentions tools like Tableau, SQL, Power BI, and Python. The user is seeking opinions or advice on whether they can manage or succeed in the course. This indicates the user is in the process of learning or enhancing their skills, possibly for career advancement or a new role that might involve Google's products or services. The intent here can be classified as \"HOT_LEAD\" because the individual is investing time in learning data analytics, which could imply they or their organization are looking to utilize data analytics tools, potentially Google's.\n\n### Step 3: Strategic Tagging (Task C)\nThe text does not express any crisis signals or viral complaints about Google. The user is asking for advice or opinion on their capability to complete a course. Therefore, the strategic tag should be \"NONE\" as there's no indication of a crisis or a direct complaint.\n\n### Step 4: Sentiment Analysis and Summary\nThe sentiment of the text appears to be neutral or slightly positive, as the user is seeking advice in a context that implies a positive intent (learning and potentially using Google-related tools). The sentiment score can be considered around 0.5, reflecting a neutral to slightly positive tone.\n\n### Step 5: JSON Output\nLet's compile the information into the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"relevant\": true,\n  \"intent\": \"HOT_LEAD\",\n  \"strategic_tag\": \"NONE\",\n  \"sentiment_score\": 0.5,\n  \"summary\": \"User is taking a Coursera course on Google Data Analytics and seeking advice on their ability to complete it, indicating potential interest or use of Google's data analytics tools.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.8,\n  \"keywords\": [\"Google Data Analytics\", \"Coursera\", \"Data Analytics\"],\n  \"feature_requests\": [],\n  \"pain_points\": [],\n  \"churn_risks\": [],\n  \"recommended_actions\": [\"Engage with the user to understand their needs and potentially offer Google's data analytics solutions or support.\"],\n  \"lead_score\": 70\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON output reflects the analysis:\n- The text is relevant to \"Google.\"\n- The intent is classified as \"HOT_LEAD\" due to the user's engagement with a data analytics course that involves Google.\n- The strategic tag is \"NONE\" as there's no crisis or complaint.\n- The sentiment score is 0.5, indicating a neutral to positive sentiment.\n- A summary is provided explaining the context.\n- Confidence is set to 0.8, indicating a high confidence in the analysis.\n- Keywords are extracted based on the content.\n- Recommended actions include engaging with the user to potentially offer Google's solutions or support, with a lead score of 70 indicating a moderate to high sales potential.","model_used":"meta/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct","latency_ms":0.0,"metadata":{}}

This indicates the text is indeed about \"google\". Therefore, the content is relevant to the brand.\n\n### TASK B: INTENT\nThe text promotes a new feature within Google Search, specifically the \"new ai mode\" and mentions watching product demos. This suggests an intent to inform or educate about a new capability, potentially attracting users or generating interest. The tone is promotional/informative rather than a complaint or negative feedback. The detected pattern is \"switching intent\", which implies the user is considering alternatives or exploring new features, potentially indicating a lead or interest. Thus, the intent can be classified as \"HOT_LEAD\" because it involves a potential user being informed about or interested in a new feature that could attract them to use or continue using Google's services.\n\n### TASK C: STRATEGY\nThe text does not express any crisis signals or viral complaints; it's promotional content about a new feature.

The primary topic of the post is about the user's experience with overclocking their PC and seeking advice on how to stabilize their RAM configuration.\n\nGiven this, the relevance to \"Google\" as a brand is tangential at best.

privacy reasons. please be respectful but honest. i would appreciate some guidance. i'm sorry, this is a long one. i'm also sorry for any spelling or grammar mistakes; i'm in a bit of a haze.* i have been with my partner, will, for over 2 years. we met through a faith community he joined at 16, which i had already been a part of for years. he attended for a while, i noticed him and caught him glancing at me often, but he never approached me. i eventually mustered up the courage to talk to him, and we hit it off. we had almost identical life goals, hobbies, interests, and passions. we clicked very well and were very much in love. my parents didn't like me dating him very much, having only met him once when they invited themselves along to my second date with him. my mother approached me, telling me she saw \"red flags in will\" that i just don't see, and other family members agreed. a lot of drama was stirred up over disliking will until we were forcefully separated by my parents after only dating for 3 months. he was blocked on everything, and i fell into a deep depression. during that dark time, will and i tried our best to stay in contact through our school-issued chromebooks with a google doc, and we made it work. he told me he loved me and we'd get through this. he became my will to live. we weren't allowed to be in contact again until an entire year later. we came back stronger than ever, our love more passionate. he was clingy and sweet and told me often that i'm his everything and that he's going to marry me someday. i believed him because i felt the same. we started planning for fun. a list of baby names, future pets, where we'd want to live, what our honeymoon location would be, all of it. we even decided to attend the same college. i had big ambitions of going to mit, but i settled for a less-popular college because it was will's best option and a guaranteed acceptance. in high school, he was not as academically ambitious as me and was insecure over his standing in more competitive colleges. that was one of the first of many sacrifices i'd make in our relationship. when it was time for us to attend college, we were so excited. we had been counting down the days until moving in. once we moved in, we had never been closer. we were both clingy and affectionate and happy, and i spent every chance i could with him. although he spent a lot of time with others, i didn't mind. i'm not the jealous type. then trouble started happening in paradise. it started small, flashes of emotional immaturity over how i felt about small things, then, when our relationship went through what all relationships go through, the communication period, he was unwilling. i did everything i could, i looked into the best ways to show active listening, how to not emotionally react to things so i wouldn't upset him, making lists of \"boundaries, wants, and needs\" and asked him to do the same, so we could come together and openly communicate and move past any bumps we had. everything. but he would fight, he'd tell me my open communication, my \"when you do \\_ i feel \\_\" statements were overly emotional and made him not want to communicate. eventually, our relationship got so tense that a simple disagreement about a pair of stockings i wanted to buy turned into a heated text conversation where i was honest. i told him i felt like he didn't care about any of my wants, needs, boundaries, or emotions. he dumped me over text during the conversation. i asked him repeatedly if this was what he wanted, and he went through with it. an hour later, he came down to my dorm room and cried. after that, i saw that he wasn't in a good headspace and he needed some peace and time to think. so i proposed a week-long break, just some time to breathe and collect himself and do some self-growth. i told him i'd work on myself, too, so we could be better together. i started journaling, spending time doing things i love, and making friends. i was dealing with a lot of insecurities after he dumped me. i felt that our relationship was unstable, and it planted a seed of anxiety in my heart that blossomed into ugly flowers of distrust. i told him upfront during our conversation at the one-week mark that it'll take time for me to trust him again, that i feared that he didn't love me as i loved him because i'd never once even thought of dumping him, and i told him of my nightmares. constant nightmares of him cheating on me, abandoning me, everything i feared. **i told him only time could heal that, but i still loved him enough to stay, but if he dumped me again, it'd stay that way**. he agreed and got back together with me. we had frequent emotional conversations after that. it didn't help that i eventually found out that while i was pretty much never invited into his dorm room (he hung out in mine even though my roommate was in there all the time, and it was much smaller than his), one of his dormmates' new girlfriend of only two months was sleeping over almost every night. i only found this out because he let it slip once in conversation that *he was falling asleep chem because the girl and his roommate stayed up late watching a movie* (**keep this in mind, it's important later)**. i'd never met the girl, but she was constantly brought up by will. i know her job, her height, her \"cute\" taste in music, her \"cute\" accent, and even what her dorm is like. once, will gushed about her in front of my roommate, and i have never been more embarrassed in my entire life. i eventually confronted will about it all, and he agreed that he sees how he talked about her was odd from an outsider perspective, but that's as far as he listened. when i told him i wasn't comfortable with her spending more time with him than i ever have and sleeping in the one-bedroom dorm he lives in almost every night, while i was only allowed up there a total of 3 times the semester, all while it was empty because he wanted sexual favors, i felt crushed. he told me it's not intimate to sleep in the same room as a girl every night and avoided the questions about why i was never even invited. i'd eventually find out that he'd tag along with her and his roommate to target and barnes and noble in the car she drove, helped her fix things in her dorm, and partook in a community event in my dorm building that i lived in, and i was never invited or even told. while i was constantly bombarded with questions every time i did anything he wasn't a part of. i quit trying to talk to him about my feelings on the subject of his dormmate situation because he either avoided it or said he's fine with it, and that's what matters. another problem that i noticed was will was in constant contact with his mother, like constant. she called 2-3 times a day and texted every other minute. just 2 days after getting back together after our week long break i heard is mom on the phone with him say \"how's your break going with op?\" in a tone that put me on edge. i asked will if he told his mom the reason we were on break, that he dumped me over text, he said he \"didn't recall\". i didn't push further but that went in the back of my mind. things started to seem like they were getting better. will seemed to have matured a bit; he was listening to me a bit more than he used to, and he was still affectionate and clingy with me. we had many sleepovers when my roommate was out of town, we went on date nights that he happily paid for because he \"loves providing\", everything was getting better. my fears were slowly washing away; we were healing. but as the end of our freshman semester came, so did trouble. while i was getting very busy studying for my many finals and working on my projects as an engineering major, i assumed will was doing the same. but when we eventually were able to spend time together, he told me he was failing 2 of his 6 classes. he said his parents were going to be so upset with him. i told him i was disappointed in him too, we had one class together and sat together in the lecture hall. i noticed that while i was taking notes or working on related homework, he was on his gaming laptop playing odd steam games, then he'd complain about his scores on quizzes while i'd coordinate with him to meet me at computer labs before the day of quizzes to study. and when we'd hang in my dorm sometimes i'd take breaks to do homework while he'd sit on reels or some mobile game. after i told him \"i am disappointed in you, you are a smart man but you aren't showing it\" something in his face twisted, something i didn't recognize. later we'd go out on a date and he had me pay for our transportation, i was willing but knew that this was new in our relationship. during the date an intense depression hit me and i shut down completely. i still dont know what it was (maybe a gut feeling) but it made me distant and silent all night. will noticed and tried to comfort me. the next day we spent together since classes were over. i was supposed to go home after finals, but decided to stay until will's finals were over to spend more time with him. his last final was in a class he already failed so he didn't need to study. we spent the day getting sweets, played video games and got intimate. he spent the night and then the next day we spent it together and had so much fun and played those silly couples quizzes on instagram until he had to leave to go to his dorm to sleep so he could go to his early final in the morning. *he seemed so loving that night, what changed?* that morning he had his final then came to my dorm like we discussed the night before so he could help me pack for winter break and then we'd leave that afternoon. but when he came down to my dorm, something was off. he wouldn't look me in the eye, and under is arm he had the hand-made gift i made him for his birthday. an embroidery of a baby, symbollic of our future we'd planned together. i asked him why he brought it down, he said he \"had nowhere to hang it\". i asked him if it upset him and he cried where he sat and said \"no, i love it, it's beautiful, i want to have babies with you\". so i thought he was just a little emotional like i was, i hate leaving his side, it reminds me of the forceful year of separation my parents put on me. so i held him, kissed his face and comforted him. then i had to get up and keep packing but i talked to him the entire time, talking about how i wanted him to meet my grandparents that were coming for the holidays, how i'm so excited to give him his gifts, etc. he was sitting still, just saying \"sure\" to whatever i said. then he asked me a question: \"*why do you think i didn't perform well academically in the second half of the semester?\"*. i was honest, and i told him he didn't take it seriously enough and treated it like high school. he just hummed. then his dad called and told him that he was outside and will told him he'd \"be down in 5 minutes\". we walked to the door, and i met him there to give him a goodbye hug and kiss, and i saw something in his eyes that stayed as i told him i loved him. he then said to me that the reason he didn't do well academically was because of the stress this relationship caused on him. i asked him if it's my fault, he said \"no, i did this to myself, *this stress is from the things i've done*\". i reassured him that we are okay, that time is healing the scars he left on me and he raised his voice at me saying \"is it really!?\" i said yes, kept rubbing his chest and telling him i loved him and that it's okay. he seemed to calm down and i gave him another goodbye kiss and i joked *\"phew, for a second i thought you were going to dump me. don't you dare try to dump me over break, mister*\" as i poked his chest. he put his hand to his face and said \"i'm going to puke\" and turned from me, i rubbed his back and asked if he's okay, then he turned to face me and told me something. it was all a blur, but he said something round-about dumping me so i asked him, \"are you dumping me?\" my eyes already watering. i looked down at the floor when he said yes. i grabbed the door knob to get him out but asked him once, not looking up \"are your sure?\", just like i did the first time he dumped me. he said yes and i walked away and he left without another word. i left for break 3 minutes later, my mom told me she bumped into will on the way out and asked me if everything was alright. i had to tell her he dumped me right before break. the car ride home was difficult. after that i initially made excuses for him. that he made a mistake, that i should forgive him and give him another chance, but now i think it's best to never get back together. i told him before that if he dumped me again i wouldn't take him back, he knew that, i asked if he's sure, he said yes. he dumped me 2 minutes before leaving, was it intentionally manipulative? why would our relationship be the reason for his poor academics when his behavior in class, his lack of effort outside of class, and the fact that his roommate and his roommate's girlfriend were ruining his sleep schedule which was actively impacting his performance in class? is he worth sticking it out for? am i doing the right thing by not taking him back? we've been no contact for 3 weeks now, he removed me on everything but my mom said she saw him at church looking for me the same week he dumped me when i wasn't there. it seems he plans on coming back to me again, i don't know what to do. he's my first kiss, first time, first boyfriend, i loved him but he's hurt me so much.\nromalılar , yoldaşlar bana bir yardım coursera dan google data analytics kursu almaya başladım. henüz ilk bölümdeyim.

executable code. unlike html/javascript approaches that require sandboxing, a2ui uses a trusted component catalog model where agents can only request pre-approved ui elements (button, form, card, etc.). the client renders these json descriptions using native widgets (react, flutter, etc.), maintaining full control over styling and branding.key innovation: separates \"what to display\" (agent's responsibility) from \"how to display\" (client's control), solving security issues in multi-agent systems. the protocol uses jsonl for streaming, making it llm-friendly for incremental generation. same json can render natively across web, mobile, and desktop platforms.addresses the \"chat wall\" problem where text-only interactions fail for structured input. instead of back-and-forth text exchanges, agents can dynamically generate action surfaces (forms, date pickers) at the moment they're needed.includes comparison with html/iframes, implementation guidance, and real-world examples.

and was insecure over his standing in more competitive colleges. that was one of the first of many sacrifices i'd make in our relationship. when it was time for us to attend college, we were so excited. we had been counting down the days until moving in. once we moved in, we had never been closer. we were both clingy and affectionate and happy, and i spent every chance i could with him. although he spent a lot of time with others, i didn't mind. i'm not the jealous type. then trouble started happening in paradise. it started small, flashes of emotional immaturity over how i felt about small things, then, when our relationship went through what all relationships go through, the communication period, he was unwilling. i did everything i could, i looked into the best ways to show active listening, how to not emotionally react to things so i wouldn't upset him, making lists of \"boundaries, wants, and needs\" and asked him to do the same, so we could come together and openly communicate and move past any bumps we had. everything. but he would fight, he'd tell me my open communication, my \"when you do \\_ i feel \\_\" statements were overly emotional and made him not want to communicate. eventually, our relationship got so tense that a simple disagreement about a pair of stockings i wanted to buy turned into a heated text conversation where i was honest. i told him i felt like he didn't care about any of my wants, needs, boundaries, or emotions. he dumped me over text during the conversation. i asked him repeatedly if this was what he wanted, and he went through with it. an hour later, he came down to my dorm room and cried. after that, i saw that he wasn't in a good headspace and he needed some peace and time to think. so i proposed a week-long break, just some time to breathe and collect himself and do some self-growth. i told him i'd work on myself, too, so we could be better together. i started journaling, spending time doing things i love, and making friends. i was dealing with a lot of insecurities after he dumped me. i felt that our relationship was unstable, and it planted a seed of anxiety in my heart that blossomed into ugly flowers of distrust. i told him upfront during our conversation at the one-week mark that it'll take time for me to trust him again, that i feared that he didn't love me as i loved him because i'd never once even thought of dumping him, and i told him of my nightmares. constant nightmares of him cheating on me, abandoning me, everything i feared. **i told him only time could heal that, but i still loved him enough to stay, but if he dumped me again, it'd stay that way**. he agreed and got back together with me. we had frequent emotional conversations after that. it didn't help that i eventually found out that while i was pretty much never invited into his dorm room (he hung out in mine even though my roommate was in there all the time, and it was much smaller than his), one of his dormmates' new girlfriend of only two months was sleeping over almost every night. i only found this out because he let it slip once in conversation that *he was falling asleep chem because the girl and his roommate stayed up late watching a movie* (**keep this in mind, it's important later)**. i'd never met the girl, but she was constantly brought up by will. i know her job, her height, her \"cute\" taste in music, her \"cute\" accent, and even what her dorm is like. once, will gushed about her in front of my roommate, and i have never been more embarrassed in my entire life. i eventually confronted will about it all, and he agreed that he sees how he talked about her was odd from an outsider perspective, but that's as far as he listened. when i told him i wasn't comfortable with her spending more time with him than i ever have and sleeping in the one-bedroom dorm he lives in almost every night, while i was only allowed up there a total of 3 times the semester, all while it was empty because he wanted sexual favors, i felt crushed. he told me it's not intimate to sleep in the same room as a girl every night and avoided the questions about why i was never even invited. i'd eventually find out that he'd tag along with her and his roommate to target and barnes and noble in the car she drove, helped her fix things in her dorm, and partook in a community event in my dorm building that i lived in, and i was never invited or even told. while i was constantly bombarded with questions every time i did anything he wasn't a part of. i quit trying to talk to him about my feelings on the subject of his dormmate situation because he either avoided it or said he's fine with it, and that's what matters. another problem that i noticed was will was in constant contact with his mother, like constant. she called 2-3 times a day and texted every other minute. just 2 days after getting back together after our week long break i heard is mom on the phone with him say \"how's your break going with op?\" in a tone that put me on edge. i asked will if he told his mom the reason we were on break, that he dumped me over text, he said he \"didn't recall\". i didn't push further but that went in the back of my mind. things started to seem like they were getting better. will seemed to have matured a bit; he was listening to me a bit more than he used to, and he was still affectionate and clingy with me. we had many sleepovers when my roommate was out of town, we went on date nights that he happily paid for because he \"loves providing\", everything was getting better. my fears were slowly washing away; we were healing. but as the end of our freshman semester came, so did trouble. while i was getting very busy studying for my many finals and working on my projects as an engineering major, i assumed will was doing the same. but when we eventually were able to spend time together, he told me he was failing 2 of his 6 classes. he said his parents were going to be so upset with him. i told him i was disappointed in him too, we had one class together and sat together in the lecture hall. i noticed that while i was taking notes or working on related homework, he was on his gaming laptop playing odd steam games, then he'd complain about his scores on quizzes while i'd coordinate with him to meet me at computer labs before the day of quizzes to study. and when we'd hang in my dorm sometimes i'd take breaks to do homework while he'd sit on reels or some mobile game. after i told him \"i am disappointed in you, you are a smart man but you aren't showing it\" something in his face twisted, something i didn't recognize. later we'd go out on a date and he had me pay for our transportation, i was willing but knew that this was new in our relationship. during the date an intense depression hit me and i shut down completely. i still dont know what it was (maybe a gut feeling) but it made me distant and silent all night. will noticed and tried to comfort me. the next day we spent together since classes were over. i was supposed to go home after finals, but decided to stay until will's finals were over to spend more time with him. his last final was in a class he already failed so he didn't need to study. we spent the day getting sweets, played video games and got intimate. he spent the night and then the next day we spent it together and had so much fun and played those silly couples quizzes on instagram until he had to leave to go to his dorm to sleep so he could go to his early final in the morning. *he seemed so loving that night, what changed?* that morning he had his final then came to my dorm like we discussed the night before so he could help me pack for winter break and then we'd leave that afternoon. but when he came down to my dorm, something was off. he wouldn't look me in the eye, and under is arm he had the hand-made gift i made him for his birthday. an embroidery of a baby, symbollic of our future we'd planned together. i asked him why he brought it down, he said he \"had nowhere to hang it\". i asked him if it upset him and he cried where he sat and said \"no, i love it, it's beautiful, i want to have babies with you\". so i thought he was just a little emotional like i was, i hate leaving his side, it reminds me of the forceful year of separation my parents put on me. so i held him, kissed his face and comforted him. then i had to get up and keep packing but i talked to him the entire time, talking about how i wanted him to meet my grandparents that were coming for the holidays, how i'm so excited to give him his gifts, etc. he was sitting still, just saying \"sure\" to whatever i said. then he asked me a question: \"*why do you think i didn't perform well academically in the second half of the semester?\"*. i was honest, and i told him he didn't take it seriously enough and treated it like high school. he just hummed. then his dad called and told him that he was outside and will told him he'd \"be down in 5 minutes\". we walked to the door, and i met him there to give him a goodbye hug and kiss, and i saw something in his eyes that stayed as i told him i loved him. he then said to me that the reason he didn't do well academically was because of the stress this relationship caused on him. i asked him if it's my fault, he said \"no, i did this to myself, *this stress is from the things i've done*\". i reassured him that we are okay, that time is healing the scars he left on me and he raised his voice at me saying \"is it really!?\" i said yes, kept rubbing his chest and telling him i loved him and that it's okay. he seemed to calm down and i gave him another goodbye kiss and i joked *\"phew, for a second i thought you were going to dump me. don't you dare try to dump me over break, mister*\" as i poked his chest. he put his hand to his face and said \"i'm going to puke\" and turned from me, i rubbed his back and asked if he's okay, then he turned to face me and told me something. it was all a blur, but he said something round-about dumping me so i asked him, \"are you dumping me?\" my eyes already watering. i looked down at the floor when he said yes. i grabbed the door knob to get him out but asked him once, not looking up \"are your sure?\", just like i did the first time he dumped me. he said yes and i walked away and he left without another word. i left for break 3 minutes later, my mom told me she bumped into will on the way out and asked me if everything was alright. i had to tell her he dumped me right before break. the car ride home was difficult. after that i initially made excuses for him. that he made a mistake, that i should forgive him and give him another chance, but now i think it's best to never get back together. i told him before that if he dumped me again i wouldn't take him back, he knew that, i asked if he's sure, he said yes. he dumped me 2 minutes before leaving, was it intentionally manipulative? why would our relationship be the reason for his poor academics when his behavior in class, his lack of effort outside of class, and the fact that his roommate and his roommate's girlfriend were ruining his sleep schedule which was actively impacting his performance in class? is he worth sticking it out for? am i doing the right thing by not taking him back? we've been no contact for 3 weeks now, he removed me on everything but my mom said she saw him at church looking for me the same week he dumped me when i wasn't there. it seems he plans on coming back to me again, i don't know what to do. he's my first kiss, first time, first boyfriend, i loved him but he's hurt me so much.\nromalılar , yoldaşlar bana bir yardım coursera dan google data analytics kursu almaya başladım. henüz ilk bölümdeyim.

executable code. unlike html/javascript approaches that require sandboxing, a2ui uses a trusted component catalog model where agents can only request pre-approved ui elements (button, form, card, etc.). the client renders these json descriptions using native widgets (react, flutter, etc.), maintaining full control over styling and branding.key innovation: separates \"what to display\" (agent's responsibility) from \"how to display\" (client's control), solving security issues in multi-agent systems. the protocol uses jsonl for streaming, making it llm-friendly for incremental generation. same json can render natively across web, mobile, and desktop platforms.addresses the \"chat wall\" problem where text-only interactions fail for structured input. instead of back-and-forth text exchanges, agents can dynamically generate action surfaces (forms, date pickers) at the moment they're needed.includes comparison with html/iframes, implementation guidance, and real-world examples. the protocol is complementary to existing frameworks (react, flutter) rather than replacing them.\na2ui: google's declarative ui protocol for ai agents\ngoogle, openai, anthropic and y combinator are

keys, I will process each text individually.\n\n1. **First Text**: The sentiment is negative towards Microsoft and Google's practices, indicating a critical view on how companies handle their services and competition. Sentiment Score: Negative.\n\n2. **Second Text**: The discussion revolves around capitalism and companies' strategies, maintaining a somewhat negative tone due to the context of \"destroying\" competition. Sentiment Score: Negative.\n\n3. **Third Text**: The user is seeking help for a specific product (\"neural superchargers+sleep accelerators\") on Steam and Google, indicating a neutral/inquiring sentiment. Sentiment Score: Neutral.\n\n4. **Fourth Text**: The tone is promotional/inviting as the user is asking for testers for their game, \"Cosmic Collapse.\" Sentiment Score: Positive.\n\n5. **Fifth Text**: The user is inquiring about a VHS tape, showing curiosity and a neutral tone. Sentiment Score: Neutral.\n\n6. **Sixth Text (Long Personal Story)**: The overall sentiment is negative due to the painful and distressing experiences described in the relationship. Sentiment Score: Negative.\n\n7. **Seventh Text**: The user is inquiring about the feasibility of taking a Google Data Analytics course on Coursera, showing a neutral/inquiring tone.

The sentiments vary but are mostly neutral or informative.\n\nTo simplify, let's categorize the sentiment of the texts into positive, negative, and neutral based on their content:\n\n- **Negative Sentiment**: Texts that express dissatisfaction, criticism, or negative emotions. (e.g., the first, second, and sixth texts)\n- **Neutral Sentiment**: Texts that are inquiring, informative, or neutral in tone. (e.g., the third, fifth, seventh, eighth, ninth texts, and most others)\n- **Positive Sentiment**: Texts that are promotional, supportive, or positive. (e.g., the fourth text)\n\nLet's calculate the sentiment distribution:\n\n1. Negative texts: 3 (first, second, sixth)\n2. Neutral texts: 12 (third, fifth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and others not explicitly listed but generally neutral)\n3. Positive texts: 1 (fourth)\n\nTotal texts = 16\n\n- **Negative proportion**: 3/16 = 0.1875\n- **Neutral proportion**: 12/16 = 0.75\n- **Positive proportion**: 1/16 = 0.0625\n\nNormalizing to ensure the proportions sum to 1:\n- The proportions are already close to summing to 1 (0.1875 + 0.75 + 0.0625 = 1).\n\nThus, the JSON output with the sentiment analysis is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"positive\": 0.0625,\n  \"negative\": 0.1875,\n  \"neutral\": 0.75\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON object represents the distribution of sentiment across the analyzed texts, with the values summing to 1 as required.","model_used":"meta/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct","latency_ms":0.0,"metadata":{}}

They express confusion about the pricing of certain camping gear based on the materials used. The tone is more inquisitive and analytical rather than emotional. The author is seeking recommendations for good, affordable camping gear and materials. The sentiment here is generally neutral with a slightly positive tone due to the enthusiasm for finding good deals.\n\n2. **Second Text**: This is a short message in Italian about sharing a referral code for Amazon to receive a €30 voucher. The sentiment is positive as it involves sharing something beneficial.\n\n3. **Third Text**: The text discusses a deal found on Amazon for a folding heavy-duty dolly cart. The tone is informative, highlighting the price and the savings. The sentiment is positive due to the excitement about finding a good deal.\n\nTo quantify the sentiment, we will assign values to positive, negative, and neutral sentiments based on the analysis.\n\n- The overall sentiment of the texts is more on the positive and neutral side since there's discussion about finding good deals and sharing beneficial information, with no strongly negative emotions expressed.\n\nLet's assign the values:\n- **Positive**: The texts show enthusiasm for deals and sharing beneficial information. So, a significant portion of the sentiment is positive.\n- **Neutral**: The first text is largely neutral/informative. Thus, a considerable part of the sentiment is neutral.\n- **Negative**: There's no strong negative sentiment expressed in the texts.\n\nGiven the above analysis, let's quantify the sentiments. Assuming the first text contributes a mix of neutral and positive sentiment, the second and third texts contribute to positive sentiment.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"positive\": 0.55,\n  \"negative\": 0.0,\n  \"neutral\": 0.45\n}\n```\n\nThese values sum to 1 and reflect the overall sentiment analysis of the given texts. The \"positive\" value is higher due to the deal discussions and the sharing of beneficial information. The \"neutral\" value is significant because of the informative and analytical nature of the first text. There's no \"negative\" sentiment as there's no expression of negative emotions or complaints.","model_used":"meta/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct","latency_ms":0.0,"metadata":{}}

The user mentions having saved up $300 and discusses various options and concerns regarding the quality and compatibility of different products. Although the text does not directly mention \"amazon,\" the context implies that the user might be considering purchasing from various brands or retailers, potentially including Amazon, given that it's a major e-commerce platform for such products.\n\nSince the text doesn't directly mention Amazon but is related to a product category that Amazon sells, we need to assess its relevance. The task implies that the brand \"amazon\" is the focus, and the detected pattern is \"switching intent.\" The user is seeking advice on products that Amazon sells, so it's tangentially related.\n\nGiven the context that \"amazon\" is MY_CLIENT and the detected pattern is switching intent, we can infer that the discussion is relevant because it involves a potential purchase decision that could involve Amazon.\n\nThus, **\"relevant\": true**.\n\n### TASK B: INTENT\nThe user is seeking advice on purchasing specific motorcycle gear and discussing their requirements and budget.

This indicates the user is considering using \"amazon\" for delivery but is uncertain about its availability in their parents' area. The intent here is to inquire about a service, which suggests potential purchase intent or interest in using \"amazon\" if it delivers to the area.

Therefore, this is relevant to \"amazon.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"relevant\": true\n}\n```\n\n### TASK B: INTENT CLASSIFICATION\nThe user is expressing frustration and seeking advice on whether to continue selling a product on Amazon Canada due to poor sales. The intent here is not directly related to a complaint about Amazon's service (which would be CHURN_RISK) but is more about seeking advice on a business decision related to selling on Amazon. The user is not reporting a bug or praising Amazon. The text doesn't directly indicate a general comment without a specific intent. However, the context suggests the user is a potential HOT_LEAD for Amazon's seller services or tools that could help improve their sales.\n\nGiven the context and the content, the most appropriate classification is not directly listed, but considering the options, **FEATURE_REQUEST** or **GENERAL** might seem plausible. However, the user is discussing their struggles and potential next steps with their product on Amazon, which doesn't directly translate to a feature request. The closest intent would be **GENERAL** as it's not a direct lead, churn risk, bug report, or praise. Yet, understanding the nuance, the user is discussing their business strategy on Amazon, which could be seen as an opportunity for Amazon to offer services or support.\n\nUpon closer inspection, the intent is more aligned with **CHURN_RISK** because the user is considering removing their product from Amazon due to dissatisfaction with sales performance, which is indirectly a dissatisfaction with the platform's effectiveness for their business.\n\n### TASK C: STRATEGY\nThe user is not expressing a viral complaint or crisis signal that would indicate a **CRITICAL_ALERT**. The post is a query for advice on a business decision and is not attacking or criticizing Amazon directly. Thus, the appropriate strategic tag is **NONE**.\n\n### OUTPUT JSON\nLet's synthesize the information:\n\n- **Relevant**: True, as it's about Amazon.\n- **Intent**: Upon reflection, **CHURN_RISK** is a more appropriate classification because the user is at risk of leaving or discontinuing their business on Amazon.\n- **Strategic Tag**: **NONE**, as there's no critical alert or viral complaint.\n- **Sentiment Score**: The sentiment is somewhat negative due to frustration but not extremely so, as the user is seeking advice. A score around -0.2 to -0.5 could reflect this mixed sentiment, but let's adjust our understanding to fit the scale and context. A neutral to slightly negative sentiment might be around -0.3.\n- **Summary**: The user is seeking advice on whether to continue selling on Amazon Canada due to poor sales in a competitive niche.\n- **Confidence**: High, as the analysis is based on clear indicators in the text.\n- Other fields will be populated based on the analysis.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"relevant\": true,\n  \"intent\": \"CHURN_RISK\",\n  \"strategic_tag\": \"NONE\",\n  \"sentiment_score\": -0.3,\n  \"summary\": \"Seller on Amazon Canada is struggling with low sales and seeking advice on whether to continue or remove their product.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.8,\n  \"keywords\": [\"Amazon Canada\", \"seller struggles\", \"low sales\"],\n  \"feature_requests\": [],\n  \"pain_points\": [\"low sales\", \"high competition\", \"ineffective ads\"],\n  \"churn_risks\": [\"poor sales performance\", \"considering removal of product\"],\n  \"recommended_actions\": [\"Offer support or tools to improve sales performance\", \"Consider reaching out to the seller with relevant Amazon services\"],\n  \"lead_score\": 0\n}\n```\n\nThis output reflects the analysis and adheres to the required JSON format. The user is not a direct sales lead but is at risk of churning due to dissatisfaction with their sales performance on Amazon.

This context suggests the user is inquiring about Amazon Locker, a service provided by Amazon for secure package delivery. Therefore, the text is indeed about \"amazon\".\n\n```json\n\"relevant\": true\n```\n\n### TASK B: INTENT\nThe user is asking for information about an Amazon Locker location. This indicates they are likely expecting a package or are interested in using the service, which can be associated with an intent to receive or has received a purchase. The intent here seems more related to an existing customer or someone expecting a delivery, rather than expressing dissatisfaction or making a complaint. The intent is not directly a lead but is related to an existing service. Thus, it can be classified as GENERAL, as it doesn't directly indicate a HOT_LEAD, CHURN_RISK, BUG_REPORT, or other specific intents.\n\n```json\n\"intent\": \"GENERAL\"\n```\n\n### TASK C: STRATEGY\nThe text does not express any crisis signals or viral complaints.

Therefore, it should be tagged as \"NONE\".\n\n```json\n\"strategic_tag\": \"NONE\"\n```\n\n### Sentiment Score and Summary\nThe sentiment of the text appears neutral or slightly positive due to the context of using Amazon's services.
